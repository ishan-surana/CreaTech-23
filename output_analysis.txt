1) It is observerd that keywords like 'build', 'construction' and 'infrastructure' with moderate number of upvotes lead to positive sentiment. Because, as the posts of the dataset suggest, L&T is considered to be one of the best companies in India for the work.
2) The keyword 'stock' leads to positive sentiment as well. The posts of the dataset lead to the conclusion that L&T stocks are overall great to invest in for long-term, and most post view them in a positive light.
3) High upvotes lead to negative sentiment. This is because the most upvoted posts of the dataset relate to the major controversy posts on Reddit.

This is a somewhat biased model due to the dataset being comprised on scraping data only from Reddit. In further updates, this may be diluted and rectified successfully.
