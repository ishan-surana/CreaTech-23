Larsen and toubro,"
    
    Holding 32 shares averaged at 2800, what are your views about this script?
  
    Edit: thank you for these replies, i did base the investment out of fundamental decisions, started buying it around 2100 levels. I am still strong on the stock over the next 3-5 years, the 5% drop threw me off today.

"[RANT] Should I quit Larsen and Toubro ""The company that built India""??","
    
    TLDR: Disillusioned with the actual work being done inside L&T, alloted job which will not build relevant experience for me and debating whether i should leave after observing the slow beauracracy, poor equipment and work culture.
  
    L&T came to our campus for placement in the middle of 7th semseter and after clearing their 3 rounds of interview and health test, they ghosted me, around march they got back saying that i am selected and requested me to update data on their internal tracking system with the usual WITCH stuff, marksheets for all semesters, 10th and 12th marksheets, and the usual fare. After that they again went radio silent. In mid June, I finally received the offer letter which specified that I was alloted Heavy Engineering IC and i was to be deployed to a remote location. The pay is 6LPA CTC (36k inhand per month).
  
    The joining was conducted soon and we spent 3 days in a 5 star facility post which we were told to report at our respective alloted locations. At our location we spent like two weeks during which we visited the workshops and saw what was being done. We were subsequently alloted our departments. They make you apply for NATS, which is a government scheme through which they get like 3 lakh inr from the government, they make you sign a document which basically says you're a retard, totally incapable of understanding or doing anything, a piece of shit not worth employing and so they are training you to become "" employable"". I was deployed to a remote corner of India where it is always raining, half the time the electricity is down, the mobile network is dogshit and is a small town with just the basic necessities with half the population of the town being composed of L&T employees. I was alloted the accounting group (As an EC graduate, yes!) and as such, i got to go through a few contracts, you wouldn't believe the margins they are booking!
  
    Regarding Technical Expertise, L&T is literal dogshit, they just put stuff together like legos. All the parts are bought from other contractors and are just assembled together like legos with a reference blueprint which is also sent by the client. They basically collect orders from large institutions, divvy the mechanical and electrical systems seperately, and outsource it. Most of the stuff is purchased from companies like Ashok Leyland, general electric, Volvo, Tata, etc. for electronics they bought stuff from third party integrators who sold them the complete system as opposed to doing it themselves coz ""it simplified the manufacturing"". These companies are having a field day selling 100rs. worth stuff to L&T for 10,000rs. All manufacturing lines seems to be atleast 6 months behind the delivery schedule, angry customer reps would show up or call everday to ensure their project is prioritised and delivered asap. What L&T does is basically ""screwdriver technolgy"", just buy stuff in modules and plug/screw/rivet it in. They do not even have a proper warehouse to store their stuff. They bring in their metal structures and just unload it on a grass patch, the structures get wet by rain and develop rusting, then they fit the same rusted structures and just paint it over ( they do have a really good painting facility, gotta give them that) and pretend the rust was never there, they dont bother removing it as it basically gets hidden under the thick coats of paint, its the buyer's hedache to deal with later.
  
    The work computers are slow as hell, they are still runing 3rd gen core i3/i5 pcs across their organisation with 500 gig hardrives and 4 gb ram, it takes them a good 15 mins just to boot up and load up the relavant work software, some of the monitors have spots or lines and spares aren't available. There is a saftey depatment here, but its just for show, they basically spend their day loitering in the office, he is just there to claim compliance with some international standards. In reality he is powerless to enforce these standards, if he tries to do it, he gets scolded by other departments as following proper procedures delays the manufacturing even more. Don't even get me started on the ""state of the art manufacturing"", the bulk of the work is still being done manually, with each item being riveted/installed manually by a person, when it could also be done on an assembly line, because its cheaper. Whenever something goes wrong, its all about playing the blame game and passing the buck with little to no interest in actually trying to fix the issue.
  
    Work life balance is basically non existent. 7am to 6pm are the regular working hours and there is no paid overtime, workdays are monday to saturday. It is basically go to work, work, come back from work, sleep, go to work. You are left with little to no time to pursue your hobbies/ prepare for career/ just chill out, not that there is much to do here in the middle of nowhere in a small town. They have an alarming 70% attrition rate for fresh grads with most people leaving within a year. The seniors also advised us to keep looking for jobs and to exit asap if you care about your career.  I have nothing against my boss, he is a really chill dude and helpful guy, but he is kinda powerless and everything needs to be done through some internal software, which is old, outdated and buggy af, their internal software looks like its from 2005. The HR department is really passive and don't seem invested in solving your issues, a coworker of mine has been trying to get a reimbursement for over 4 months which got held up due to some glitch in their system. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem. Employees are often left without recourse or solutions to their problems.
  
    I think i am slowly losing both my health and sanity, i have suffered from fever and light dysentery as well as sleepless nights wondering if it even worth it to stay and compromise on life just for work. They have a one month notice period now and 3 month for permanent employees.

Larsen and Toubro withholding FnF Salary,"
    
    I quit L&T 2 months back and i have not received my final month's salary even though a payslip was generated. I have not received a relieving letter/experience letter either. After I mailed the hr who handled my exit proceedings multiple times over several weeks, i finally got the following response
  
    
  
    ""Your All clearance formalities are not completed on SSC Portal, Pls check balance dept & speak to concern for completing it on priority.
  
    After completing all formalities, SSC will take around 10-15 days to release salary. This was clearly communicated to you during exit formalities. ""
  
    However my access to the SSC portal is suspended to all sections excluding my PF section since I am no longer an L&T Employee. I thought  i was showing them courtesy by giving them time to clear my dues instead they spun the tale around by saying i do not have clearances from all departments. On the day I left, i personally contacted all involved departments to approve my leave request. Some of them approved my request within a few hours while others said it would be approved within a week due to departmental beauracracy. Do note no updates were sent to me regarding who approved my request and who didnt and the page to check the same on the SSC portal is not available to me as i am not an employee anymore.
  
    How do i get them to payup my dues? Even the payslip they had generated, I dont necessarily agree with. My pay is divided up across as basic pay, flexipay, rent and food allowance and telephone allowance. My earnings for the month seem to have been given on a prorata basis but my deductions have been made for the entire month, and they have not alloted me the flexi pay for the final month as per the payslip. I also had a pending travel reimbursement which seems to have been ignored.
  
    I might be okay with not collecting the fractional amount they are withholding via penny pinching on payslip but i find the fact of withholding the amount as per their generated payslip for over 2 months even after all formalities from my side have been executed to the best of my abilities outrageous.
  
    What should I do? I even bought out my notice period to ensure my documents are in order but now i kinda feel like a silent exit may have been in order...

Larsen & Toubro can't afford Windows,"
    
    L&T are such cheapskates that they can't even afford to get licenses for windows, ms office even when posting multi billion dollar profits. The pcs are also pretty old, the vast majority being 4th-6th gen core i3/i5.

Think Larsen & Toubro is a great company with great ethics and all that rubbish? Think again.,"
    
    I  was browsing thru the sub and when I saw [HCL sending out appointment  letters after 3 years of accepting the candidate. Should be reported.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36ush4/hcl_sending_out_appointment_letters_after_3_years/) and I thought maybe you guys might be able to help us.
  
    L&T  came to our college for placements in 2014, held one of the most  toughest placement procedures lasting two days, consisting of two tests,  on GD and two interviews, selected the students and never sent them the  DOJ's. Their pay package was genuinely below par for a core company but  since we wanted a core job, we accepted their offer and so because of  college rules, we could not sit for other placements.
  
    L&T  being a core company also meant we expected them to be a little more  professional. It's been more than a year since we got selected and we  are still sitting with no date of joining. They could have simply  selected fewer students and I would have been fine with that, but then,  they selected us, and did not give us the date of joining. I know people  who have taken loans and are basically doing odd jobs like for 5-10k a  month, trying to make ends meet to pay back the loans. It is disgusting,  and it would be nothing short of fraud what they are doing.
  
    Obviously,  we as students can move on, apply else where and get on with our lives.  But there are a lot of us still waiting, doing odd jobs, waiting. I  dont know what they try to achieve by recruiting such large numbers and  keep them waiting for YEARS at end. This is wrong.
  Please upvote this for visibility.
    Okay  now a lot of you guys are insisting that we should have moved on/  should move on, and I myself mentioned that we could have, but the  problem is that at the time when you get placed, you do not know that  you are going to get screwed over, because the whole thing is hyped so  much, and they promptly send you the letters of intent, and tell you  that you might have to wait for a bit.
  
    ""A  bit"" is not one year. ""A bit"" is two to four months. Maybe six. Not a  year. Definitely not more than a year. So you wait for about 3 months  till after college gets over. During the third month, you see that all  of your friends have started working.
  
    In  the fourth month, now you are really alone. You try calling up the HR  department at the company, and they say, yes yes we will give you the  date by maximum by this month end. This has been happening for the past  one year.
  
    Now, I think a lot of you must  be knowing that once you are out of college, and the placement season is  over, it is very, very difficult to apply for a job. Also, a lot of  people want to pursue higher education/ pay back loans and this makes it  very difficult to do so.

This sign outside Larsen and Toubro in Shivajinagar.,Text not found,57,negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/15csrni/this_sign_outside_larsen_and_toubro_in/
"[Rant] The inside story on Larsen & Toubro, the supposed people responsible for building India","
    
    Created from throwaway for obvious reasons.
  Starting point
    Fifth semester of engineering college in India. L&T are usually among the first companies to arrive on the average campus for interviews. There is usually the funda where once a student has a job offer, he or she is not allowed to attend subsequent interviews. Well, four other people and I were all selected by Larsen & Toubro. Ok. We were ecstatic. Then came the shock of the starting package which was barely touching 3 lakhs a year. Ok, we swallowed that when professors and senior students told us that L&T was a great place to start your career. Fine. This was compared to 5+ for several other companies. While at this point in your career, you need the organisation more than the organisation needs you, it must be said that humans, especially college students, will compare salaries. This is the starting point that produces disgruntled employees. Money, while not the sole factor, is important.
  
    Next came the recession. Mid way through the seventh semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they might not be able to recruit everyone and that we should start looking for alternate opportunities. This is almost a year after the original offer, by which time other large corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left high and dry with no guaranteed employment. Ok. Making the best of the situation, I searched hard and found jobs at three difference companies. A month into the job, i get a call from L&T stating that I could be offered a job the next month. Ok. Being naive and not too satisfied with my present job, i decided to take the offer. So i join, along with everyone else who was originally recruited. Excellent news so far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. I was assigned to their office in Gujarat. I must mention that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding name was assigned some or the other department in Powai, Mumbai. Ok, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty part. I ended up at a department rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions by doing whatever the boss asked for. I wasn't prepared to do this mostly because of morals. Unfortunately, i had neither wisdom nor age on my side which led to some needless confrontations with the management.
  
    Now L&T have this Management Trainee program where they put all the graduate recruits through a series of tests and interviews to determine whom to put on the MT program. In my department of 200 odd employees, we were 17 GETs (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written test round. Of the six who got through, five left the organisation within two years. Only one remains. This illustrated one thing to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  General Work
    Now, about work. Accusations were flying thick and fast right from the start about how regionalism and favouritism were rampant. Examples were cited. How much truth there was in these accusations, i cannot say. What i did observe was a persistent culture of ass licking. The boss is always right. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss must be worshipped. I did not subscribe to this school of thought and i made my views clear. I challenged my boss' views openly but politely. He did not take kindly to it. I only discovered this later.
  
    About work, L&T is basically a large contractor taking tech from abroad and just installing it in india. There is often little expertise that they actually contribute despite what the ads tell you. This was true in my department. Others, i cannot comment on. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from upper management. L&T has numerous internal companies manufacturing different pieces of equipment. The pressure was often to award contracts to these people instead of better quality and cheaper alternatives from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later when equipment was installed and found defective or just badly designed.
  Time pressures
    Everything had to be done in advance of contracted deadlines even if this meant storing sensitive equipment in the open at the mercy of the elements. No matter that the person who agreed to the deadlines had no actual idea how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to equipment being dispatched in pieces which were often not labelled and which were hard to reassemble later.
  Safety
    This existed as a token person claiming to be a safety officer on a construction site. The reality was that he was just there to claim compliance with some international standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything about blatant safety violations on a construction site. To name a few, daily wage labourers were found working with no fire safety equipment when welding and often inhaling dangerous fumes. Safety harnesses were often tattered and old. Mind you, this is from a company bidding for international contracts and i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    If you work at one of larsen & toubro's construction sites, your life is fucked. I am not saying this lightly. You work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""site allowance"". Facilities for accommodation will be terrible to begin with and will only improve should employees protest. Then too, improvements will be grudgingly made. The clients are infinitely more important than the employees. We were made to arrive at work at 0830 and leave at 1930. That is eleven hours, six days a week. Employees at the office in Gujarat got alternate saturdays off. We were not afforded this luxury because you know, you're our bitch. No recreation facilities despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The fact that were were given a ""site allowance"" was akin to asking a beggar to be satisfied with the 10 rupee note you've handed him. Taking sundays off was frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to avoid going to work on weekends.
  Performance Appraisals
    based on a normal distribution. I am not joking. Every department has to abide by this. This resulted in people working their asses off at a construction site being told that their work was under par because someone had to be in that category while people chilling in the office making power point presentations were told that their work was fantastic. More often than not, the top performers were decided based on regionalism. In a department headed by a bong, expect to see bongs as top performers.
  Employee satisfaction
    Seventeen GETs joined the company with me. I was number 14 to leave. After me, one more person left. The two that remain are still there. Every single one of my colleagues at my construction site were desperately searching for alternate jobs. Add to this the fact that GETs are treated like entitled kids while people with more experience joining the company from outside are treated like shit. This is no exaggeration. I've seen it first hand. Ask around yourself if you don't believe me. There was a Gallup survey that was conducted one year, the results of which were never made known to the employees. You can guess at the reasons.
  Pointless and Ineffective HR Practices
    Again, to claim compliance with international practices and to periodically appease employees, MANDATORY HR related courses would be forced down our throats every year. There was no choice given to employees. There did exist a system where you could choose what sort of training you wanted to receive ranging from technical to soft skills. Despite numerous requests, management just turned me down claiming that it was a waste of time. Yes, these people run the company and then wonder why people leave. Then there is the issue of bonds. Yes, every time the company invests more than a single rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a two year bond to begin with. Now, from what i hear, people are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some sort of executive training programs. Just how long the bond period is on that, i wonder.
  Racism
    Yes, it happened and it happened in the open. People were blind to it. A colleague and I were probably the only ones that noticed. The indian engineers were housed in an often muddy floored office. It was air conditioned so that was good. Anyone with white skin got a private office with their own internet connection and colour printer. The indians did not deserve either clean toilets or a colour printer or internet access. Yes, this actually happened. Caucasian people who were technician level but representing the western manufacturers of critical equipment got treatment fit for kings. Anyone indian looking, no matter which company they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The End
    After seeing numerous colleagues leave in frustration, i too threw in the towel. I was asked publicly whether i'd like to return. I answered no and was met with a stunned silence from all around me.
  Conclusions
    People leave bad managers, not companies, it is said. In the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a toxic combination of the two where your manager is powerless to fix the situation. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem. Employees are often left with recourse or solutions to their problems. The preferred way out is to leave. You can compare the attrition rates for L&T (not infotech) and the average IT company and both will be comparable. These numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.
  
    TL;DR If you're studying to become an engineer, think twice before joining Larsen & Toubro. This is my honest advice. Then again, this could be the situation in most indian engineering / contracting companies.

"Walked out of my job from Larsen and Toubro which is supposedly a ""Great Place to Work"". What do I do now?","
    
    So I just sent in my resignation at the job which was really eating me out from inside and leaving me with depression. Now I am wondering what should I do? Should I pursue an MBA? or prepare for a government job, or look around for other jobs in private sector?
  
    I am not against working in a foreign country or working at remote sites as long as the pay is decent and there is sufficient time to unwind with management not up my ass. My family is in debt, so I really don't wanna impose on them with further studies, so really conflicted about pursuing an MBA,ideally I'd wanna help out clear the debt and for that a well paying job would really help out. Most companies don't seem interested in hiring a fresher. Moreover a lot of companies seem to be only interested in hiring from IIT and NIT only, As someone from a tier 3 government college, I am from an electronics and telecommunication background am hving a hard time convincing people with my Cv, I have experience in analog circuits and Frontend design but my coding skills are just about average, which kinda makes me apprehensive about applying to IT jobs.
  
    Could someone recommend me what should I do and how should I play out my cards ?

A word of caution to freshers - My experience with Larsen & Toubro,"
    
    created from throwaway for apparent motives.
  starting point
    5th semester of engineering college in India. L&T are commonly most of the first organizations to reach on the common campus for interviews. there is normally the funda where as soon as a pupil has a task offer, he or she isn't allowed to wait subsequent interviews. properly, 4 other human beings and i were all decided on by means of Larsen & Toubro. ok. We have been ecstatic. Then got here the surprise of the beginning package deal which become barely touching three lakhs a year. good enough, we swallowed that after professors and senior college students advised us that L&T turned into a tremendous location to start your career. best. This turned into compared to five+ for numerous other agencies. even as at this point in your profession, you need the enterprise extra than the employer desires you, it ought to be said that people, specially college students, will evaluate salaries. this is the starting point that produces disgruntled personnel. money, while no longer the only component, is essential.
  
    next got here the recession. Mid manner through the 7th semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they won't be able to recruit all and sundry and that we must start searching out trade opportunities. that is almost a 12 months after the original offer, by means of which era different huge corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left excessive and dry with out a assured employment. good enough. Making the first-rate of the situation, I searched difficult and observed jobs at 3 distinction organizations. A month into the activity, i am getting a call from L&T pointing out that I can be offered a task the subsequent month. good enough. Being naive and now not too happy with my present job, i decided to take the provide. So i be a part of, along with all and sundry else who became initially recruited. superb news thus far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. i used to be assigned to their office in Gujarat. I need to point out that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding call become assigned a few or the alternative branch in Powai, Mumbai. adequate, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty component. i ended up at a branch rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions via doing regardless of the boss requested for. I wasn't prepared to do that in general due to morals. sadly, i had neither know-how nor age on my side which brought about some needless confrontations with the control.
  
    Now L&T have this control Trainee software in which they placed all of the graduate recruits thru a series of checks and interviews to decide whom to place at the MT program. In my department of two hundred unusual personnel, we were 17 gets (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written check spherical. Of the six who got through, 5 left the organisation within  years. most effective one stays. This illustrated one element to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  general paintings
    Now, approximately work. Accusations were flying thick and rapid right from the begin approximately how regionalism and favouritism have been rampant. Examples were mentioned. How a great deal fact there has been in those accusations, i can't say. What i did study changed into a continual lifestyle of ass licking. The boss is constantly proper. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss have to be worshipped. I did now not join this school of idea and that i made my perspectives clean. I challenged my boss' views brazenly however with courtesy. He did not take kindly to it. I simplest found this later.
  
    about work, L&T is basically a big contractor taking tech from overseas and simply installing it in india. there is often little expertise that they virtually make a contribution in spite of what the advertisements let you know. This became authentic in my branch. Others, i cannot touch upon. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from top control. L&T has severa internal companies manufacturing special portions of equipment. The stress turned into regularly to award contracts to those humans instead of better excellent and cheaper options from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later while equipment was hooked up and discovered faulty or simply badly designed.
  Time pressures
    the entirety needed to be done earlier of shriveled cut-off dates even supposing this supposed storing sensitive device in the open on the mercy of the elements. no matter that the person that agreed to the cut-off dates had no real concept how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to gadget being dispatched in portions which have been often now not labelled and which have been tough to reassemble later.
  protection
    This existed as a token individual claiming to be a safety officer on a construction website. The fact become that he was simply there to assert compliance with a few global standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything approximately blatant protection violations on a construction site. to name some, daily wage labourers were observed operating with no fire safety gadget whilst welding and regularly breathing in risky fumes. safety harnesses were regularly tattered and antique. thoughts you, that is from a enterprise bidding for worldwide contracts and that i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    in case you work at one of larsen & toubro's production web sites, your existence is fucked. i am now not announcing this lightly. you work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""website online allowance"". centers for lodging could be horrible initially and could simplest enhance must personnel protest. Then too, upgrades will be grudgingly made. The customers are infinitely greater critical than the employees. We had been made to arrive at work at 0830 and go away at 1930. that is eleven hours, six days every week. personnel at the office in Gujarat were given trade saturdays off. We had been no longer afforded this luxury because you realize, you're our bitch. No pastime centers despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The reality that had been had been given a ""website allowance"" become comparable to asking a beggar to be glad with the 10 rupee be aware you have exceeded him. Taking sundays off become frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to keep away from going to paintings on weekends.
  performance value determinations
    based totally on a ordinary distribution. i am not joking. every branch has to abide by using this. This led to humans operating their asses off at a production website being instructed that their paintings became under par because a person had to be in that class even as humans chilling within the workplace making electricity point presentations had been informed that their work became exquisite. extra frequently than not, the pinnacle performers were determined based totally on regionalism. In a department headed via a bong, expect to see bongs as pinnacle performers.
  employee pleasure
    Seventeen receives joined the agency with me. i used to be variety 14 to depart. After me, one greater character left. the 2 that remain are nonetheless there. each unmarried one of my colleagues at my creation website have been desperately attempting to find trade jobs. add to this the truth that receives are treated like entitled children even as humans with greater experience becoming a member of the employer from out of doors are dealt with like shit. this is no exaggeration. i have seen it first hand. Ask round your self if you don't believe me. there has been a Gallup survey that changed into carried out 12 months, the consequences of which were in no way made recognized to the employees. you can wager at the reasons.
  pointless and ineffective HR Practices
    once more, to say compliance with international practices and to periodically appease personnel, obligatory HR associated publications might be compelled down our throats each yr. there has been no preference given to personnel. There did exist a machine in which you may choose what sort of education you wanted to obtain ranging from technical to soft skills. notwithstanding severa requests, control simply became me down claiming that it changed into a waste of time. yes, those people run the company and then surprise why human beings depart. Then there may be the difficulty of bonds. sure, whenever the company invests more than a unmarried rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a  yr bond initially. Now, from what i pay attention, human beings are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some kind of government schooling programs. simply how long the bond duration is on that, i'm wondering.
  Racism
    yes, it occurred and it happened within the open. people had been unaware of it. A colleague and that i were probably the handiest ones that noticed. The indian engineers had been housed in an often muddy floored workplace. It changed into air conditioned so that become true. each person with white skin were given a non-public office with their personal internet connection and coloration printer. The indians did no longer deserve either easy toilets or a color printer or internet get admission to. yes, this genuinely passed off. Caucasian folks who have been technician level however representing the western manufacturers of vital device got treatment in shape for kings. each person indian looking, irrespective of which business enterprise they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The end
    After seeing severa colleagues depart in frustration, i too threw inside the towel. i used to be asked publicly whether or not i'd like to go back. I answered no and become met with a bowled over silence from all round me.
  Conclusions
    people leave horrific managers, now not agencies, it is said. inside the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a poisonous aggregate of the 2 where your manager is powerless to restoration the situation. The senior management is ageing and often gradual to react to HR related troubles. The passive nature of the HR setup is frequently in part liable for this hassle. employees are often left with recourse or answers to their problems. The desired manner out is to leave. you could evaluate the attrition charges for L&T (no longer infotech) and the average IT agency and each will be similar. those numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.
  
    TL;DR in case you're studying to grow to be an engineer, think two times earlier than becoming a member of Larsen & Toubro. this is my honest recommendation. on the other hand, this will be the scenario in maximum indian engineering / contracting agencies.

Larsen & Toubro Infotech and MindTree merger-related discussion,"
    
    Recently read across news sites that Larsen & Toubro Infotech and Mindtree might merge to create a $22 billion entity.
  
    My questions are two-fold:
  
      
    
    Fundamentally, what happens when 2 companies merge? What does this mean from a business perspective? Is the underlying act of one company buying out another one?
  
  
    
    How does the stock market usually react to something like this? Does the price of one rise and another fall? Or it's more random without clear past data?
  
  
    
    To add more info, I own all 3 in my portfolio - L&T, LTI as well as Mindtree.
  
    Looking to understand more from a learning perspective.

    I quit L&T 3 months back and i have not received my final month's salary. After multiple emails to HR, i was told in early october to obtain certain clearances and i did exactly i was told and i was informed my salary would be credited within 15 days, which would be on november 1.

    they are now demanding Rs. 6k from me by simply editing the notice pay recovery field. At the time of quitting i was told the recovery would be made on my basic salary for the notice period month which is one month on the number of days i am not serving. I served for 16 days for that month and opted to buy out the remaining 14 days. First they kept me waiting around for 3 months and now they are trying to fk me over and asking for money from me. My basic salary was 15.5k.

"Engineering graduates of /r/india: Be very, very careful if L&T recruit you. The company has a typical lala attitude and there is no accountability, safety or ethics. Despite the ads, L&T is a terrible, terrible company to work for. Don't join, leave if you can and spread the message!","
    
    Created from throwaway for obvious reasons.
  Starting point
    Fifth semester of engineering college in India. L&T are usually among the first companies to arrive on the average campus for interviews. There is usually the funda where once a student has a job offer, he or she is not allowed to attend subsequent interviews. Well, four other people and I were all selected by Larsen & Toubro. Ok. We were ecstatic. Then came the shock of the starting package which was barely touching 3 lakhs a year. Ok, we swallowed that when professors and senior students told us that L&T was a great place to start your career. Fine. This was compared to 5+ for several other companies. While at this point in your career, you need the organisation more than the organisation needs you, it must be said that humans, especially college students, will compare salaries. This is the starting point that produces disgruntled employees. Money, while not the sole factor, is important.
  
    Next came the recession. Mid way through the seventh semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they might not be able to recruit everyone and that we should start looking for alternate opportunities. This is almost a year after the original offer, by which time other large corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left high and dry with no guaranteed employment. Ok. Making the best of the situation, I searched hard and found jobs at three difference companies. A month into the job, i get a call from L&T stating that I could be offered a job the next month. Ok. Being naive and not too satisfied with my present job, i decided to take the offer. So i join, along with everyone else who was originally recruited. Excellent news so far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. I was assigned to their office in Gujarat. I must mention that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding name was assigned some or the other department in Powai, Mumbai. Ok, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty part. I ended up at a department rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions by doing whatever the boss asked for. I wasn't prepared to do this mostly because of morals. Unfortunately, i had neither wisdom nor age on my side which led to some needless confrontations with the management.
  
    Now L&T have this Management Trainee program where they put all the graduate recruits through a series of tests and interviews to determine whom to put on the MT program. In my department of 200 odd employees, we were 17 GETs (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written test round. Of the six who got through, five left the organisation within two years. Only one remains. This illustrated one thing to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  General Work
    Now, about work. Accusations were flying thick and fast right from the start about how regionalism and favouritism were rampant. Examples were cited. How much truth there was in these accusations, i cannot say. What i did observe was a persistent culture of ass licking. The boss is always right. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss must be worshipped. I did not subscribe to this school of thought and i made my views clear. I challenged my boss' views openly but politely. He did not take kindly to it. I only discovered this later.
  
    About work, L&T is basically a large contractor taking tech from abroad and just installing it in india. There is often little expertise that they actually contribute despite what the ads tell you. This was true in my department. Others, i cannot comment on. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from upper management. L&T has numerous internal companies manufacturing different pieces of equipment. The pressure was often to award contracts to these people instead of better quality and cheaper alternatives from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later when equipment was installed and found defective or just badly designed.
  Time pressures
    Everything had to be done in advance of contracted deadlines even if this meant storing sensitive equipment in the open at the mercy of the elements. No matter that the person who agreed to the deadlines had no actual idea how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to equipment being dispatched in pieces which were often not labelled and which were hard to reassemble later.
  Safety
    This existed as a token person claiming to be a safety officer on a construction site. The reality was that he was just there to claim compliance with some international standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything about blatant safety violations on a construction site. To name a few, daily wage labourers were found working with no fire safety equipment when welding and often inhaling dangerous fumes. Safety harnesses were often tattered and old. Mind you, this is from a company bidding for international contracts and i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    If you work at one of larsen & toubro's construction sites, your life is fucked. I am not saying this lightly. You work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""site allowance"". Facilities for accommodation will be terrible to begin with and will only improve should employees protest. Then too, improvements will be grudgingly made. The clients are infinitely more important than the employees. We were made to arrive at work at 0830 and leave at 1930. That is eleven hours, six days a week. Employees at the office in Gujarat got alternate saturdays off. We were not afforded this luxury because you know, you're our bitch. No recreation facilities despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The fact that were were given a ""site allowance"" was akin to asking a beggar to be satisfied with the 10 rupee note you've handed him. Taking sundays off was frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to avoid going to work on weekends.
  Performance Appraisals
    based on a normal distribution. I am not joking. Every department has to abide by this. This resulted in people working their asses off at a construction site being told that their work was under par because someone had to be in that category while people chilling in the office making power point presentations were told that their work was fantastic. More often than not, the top performers were decided based on regionalism. In a department headed by a bong, expect to see bongs as top performers.
  Employee satisfaction
    Seventeen GETs joined the company with me. I was number 14 to leave. After me, one more person left. The two that remain are still there. Every single one of my colleagues at my construction site were desperately searching for alternate jobs. Add to this the fact that GETs are treated like entitled kids while people with more experience joining the company from outside are treated like shit. This is no exaggeration. I've seen it first hand. Ask around yourself if you don't believe me. There was a Gallup survey that was conducted one year, the results of which were never made known to the employees. You can guess at the reasons.
  Pointless and Ineffective HR Practices
    Again, to claim compliance with international practices and to periodically appease employees, MANDATORY HR related courses would be forced down our throats every year. There was no choice given to employees. There did exist a system where you could choose what sort of training you wanted to receive ranging from technical to soft skills. Despite numerous requests, management just turned me down claiming that it was a waste of time. Yes, these people run the company and then wonder why people leave. Then there is the issue of bonds. Yes, every time the company invests more than a single rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a two year bond to begin with. Now, from what i hear, people are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some sort of executive training programs. Just how long the bond period is on that, i wonder.
  Racism
    Yes, it happened and it happened in the open. People were blind to it. A colleague and I were probably the only ones that noticed. The indian engineers were housed in an often muddy floored office. It was air conditioned so that was good. Anyone with white skin got a private office with their own internet connection and colour printer. The indians did not deserve either clean toilets or a colour printer or internet access. Yes, this actually happened. Caucasian people who were technician level but representing the western manufacturers of critical equipment got treatment fit for kings. Anyone indian looking, no matter which company they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The End
    After seeing numerous colleagues leave in frustration, i too threw in the towel. I was asked publicly whether i'd like to return. I answered no and was met with a stunned silence from all around me.
  Conclusions
    People leave bad managers, not companies, it is said. In the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a toxic combination of the two where your manager is powerless to fix the situation. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem. Employees are often left with recourse or solutions to their problems. The preferred way out is to leave. You can compare the attrition rates for L&T (not infotech) and the average IT company and both will be comparable. These numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.
  
    TL;DR If you're studying to become an engineer, think twice before joining Larsen & Toubro. This is my honest advice. Then again, this could be the situation in most indian engineering / contracting companies.
  Broader problems with Indian society:
    First, Indian society is not some alien thing that was handed from heaven. It rises from the particular combination of governmental form you have chosen and the pre-existing cultural norms of Indians. In the long run, ""society"" is nothing but the sum total of people logically responding to the incentives their society sets up for them.
  
    We have chosen for ourselves an overwhelmingly large state, which controls everything, and yet does nothing. The people of India, it seems to me, are forced to eke a living in the cracks and niches of the economy, while the state dominates everything.
  
    This would not be a problem if we had a decent state. But our state was set up a long time ago. Its structures were designed for a colonial master. We didn't adjust the incentives. Our government institutions and the officers within them have a psychology of the extractive colonial masters--i.e. zero sum mentality--not the mentality of a beneficient gardner or guardian.
  
    I have seen horrible thing in india. The sort of things I would expect in Charles Dickens style Victorian novels ... but in the modern day. Horrific things. Immoral things.
  
    And yet the people doing these things were not immoral or horrific. Well not in the conventional sense. They were raised up in institutions where routinely treating people worse than cattle is the culture.
  
    Where did this culture come from? I don't know the origins, but I can tell you what maintains the culture.
  
    It is the lack of accountability. And there is no accountability because people don't see a better alternative is possible. And they can't see a better alternative is possible because there is no competition.
  
    Everywhere in society there must be competition and destruction of the corrupt and old. India venerates the old too much. It venerates old institutions and culture too much. It venerates parents and religion too much. Every attempt to introduce new varieties of healthcare solutions is stymied by some combination of old government interests, old men with power, or old unions.
  
    I cannot even collect and provide blood from a private blood bank in a remote area, although maternal hemorrhage might be very common in the area. The government will make some reason about how I might give AIDS blood to patients and will stop me from doing that. Leave aside the fact that they don't provide any blood at all, and maybe some people would not mind the risk of AIDS if it means not dying ... but what about the fact that we can demonstrate that our testing is much better than government testing. It doesn't matter. They won't evaluate our testing without a bribe. And then another bribe will be necessary to take into account the fact that our test is satisfactory, etc.
  
    Why do people demand bribes? Because their salaries are pathetic. Why are the salaries pathetic? Because the institutions can pay them some pittance, and they don't have an alternative job they can choose so the salaries don't rise. Why are there no alternative jobs? Because the government dominates the economy and there is not much private enterprise to give alternative employment.
  
    The domination of 1 Billion people by one institution, with no competition cannot be a healthy thing for any society. The mighty Soviet Union collapsed trying to centralize everything. Why is India still trying Nehru's failed dream of running everything from Delhi?
  
    People think the economy and the morals are two separate things. They aren't. They are linked. Indians who leave India are as moral as any other people. Maybe a few who come directly from India are a bit immoral, but their kids become as moral as anyone else after one generation. They just respond to the fact that obeying the rules pays you abroad.
  
    In India you get punished if you play by the rules. You can't make it. Everyone around you is breaking the rules. If you are a clerk in a hospital and someone comes for medicine, and you don't ask for a bribe, maybe that means your own kids won't get a proper education ... because you have to pay for a private school after all, since the government school is garbage and anyway requires a bribe.
  
    Why are government institutions so worthless? Its because no institution can endure without corruption and calcification for an extended period of time. You have to disrupt every institution internally. For private companies this comes by way of bankruptcy, merger, or acquisition. Sometimes, the board will reorganize the company internally prior to those drastic measures ... but that's rare.
  
    Govt. of India has had ZERO shakeups and reorganizations. It's still operating like British Raj style. Have you ever gone to meet a senior IAS officer? Do you see the army of clerks waiting outside their offices. I don't mean 4 or 5 clerks. I'm telling you, there are DOZENS of clerks. Maybe hundreds. WTF are these people all doing with their monitors and keyboards? Nobody fucking knows.
  
    If you took all those salaries and gave it to one guy, he would be a decent guy and he would do decent work without a bribe. And the rest of those people could go find work in the private sector, which would grow once the government stopped raping it every day.

My boss locked the office door and refused to let us go home until we submitted the work!,"
    
    We are a team of 6 in a room and the project was being held back because our progress was behind the projected schedule by the boss. One team member is off work for two weeks for family reasons and another team member fell ill 2 days back, the four of us are putting in overtime to pull through, we are even working after returning home and barely get time to have food. This morning our boss called us up and said he didn't care how, we needed to complete our part by end of day. We got 2 of our friends to help us out, but when we still werent done by end of day, our boss came and locked the room and said he won't let us out unless the work is done. We felt really bad for the two friends whom we called up to help us and got stuck with us. The 6 of us somehow finished the work after hours, told the boss via call and somehow left for home after the watchman came and unlocked the room on his orders.
  
    I am baffled by this behaviour. Surely this has to be illegal?
  
    P.s. we didn't even get paid for the overtime we put in because apparently "" it's not accounted in the project budget""
  
    P.p.s. if you're wondering what company it is, it's a company owned by Larsen and Toubro.
  
    Edit 1: I am not making a huge scene of this and going to police or media as it would most likely cause me to be fired and I don't have another offer in hand to fall back on. My family is kinda in debt, so I wanna contribute as much as possible. Plus it may put a trouble maker tag on me which can reduce my future job prospects. I will be shifted to a different team at another location by the end of this month, so it's just about tolerating him for this duration and I don't think it's worth risking my career for.
  
    Edit 2: no I didn't take videographic evidence of the fact but I do have some time stamped photos. Reason being I didn't wanna piss him off even further and cause him to retaliate in other ways.
  
    Edit 3: Yes I am looking for other opportunities to move out of here ASAP, talking with other people who have been here for a few years paints a bleak picture for me, very less increment, slow promotion and often uncompensated overtime.

What's your long term view on L&T?,"
    
    With the strong focus on infrastructural development in India, L&T seems positioned for further rise. It also has significant operations in Gulf and with the EU-Gulf-India corridor beinh proposed, chances are that L&T would bag huge orders if the proposal sees the daylight. Finally, L&T taps into defence structure as well. I mean the company is a large cap with huge market cap, but I still think that in the long term, the stock can multiply. What's your viewpoint?

    I have some L&T shares my grandpa had been holding for a long time, he has told me to manage the stocks now and I can't really manage it with my level of knowledge, so after watching it for a while and googling some graphs I thought maybe it's time to sell and maybe ask reddit .... Edit : I am thinking that after the buyback and recent news, the share has really reached as high as it could for now, I don't really have any other knowledge to make a decision

"About to receive first offer out of college, seems sketchy to me","
    
    I just graduated in May with a CS degree from a Penn State affiliated school in Pennsylvania. A recruiter got ahold of me a week or so ago about an opportunity that I qualified for. I learned that this is a job that will start with a 2 month training session at Larsen and Toubro Infotech(LTI), who are based in Edison, NJ and then I will be placed at one of many Fortune 500 companies to work on projects that they need people for. From my understanding, it is small software development work in java and databases, as well as systems support type of stuff.
  
    This seems sketchy to me because I'll technically be an employee of the F500 company that decides to bring me in, but they can drop me when they have no more use for me or the project is over. In this case, LTI will place me in another company that has a need. I'm worried that this will turn out to be something like Revature where people go months without being placed anywhere with student debt looming over them like the mothership from Independence Day.
  
    Does anyone have experience with LTI and know anything about this process? Or any thoughts on how sketchy this sounds?
  
    The salary that I was promised is impressive for an entry-level gig and I haven't had much luck with other applications, so I'm tempted to take this offer just for a year or two to get my foot in the door.

    Hi everyone. I am 24M and currently working in Larsen and Toubro Construction as a Senior Engineer. I am liking the job but the working hours are too much in this company considering the salary I get here. Therefore I have decided that I want to leave the company and want to either go for higher education like, M-Tech or MBA, or Government Job where working hours are less as compared to the job I am currently in. I have purchased GATE course(2024-25) but not sure whether I want to continue it because now I am getting inclined towards MBA and want to start preparing for CAT. I think doing MBA would give me good job and salary. Please guide me what should I do. If you all can tell me the real pros and cons of both the streams that would be very helpful. In the end please share some time management tips too for preparation along with my job. My qualifications are B-Tech.

    Two years ago from today, a thriving small cap company (one may even call it a startup!) called MindTree was gobbled up by L&T Infotech, a large capitalist corporation which is part of the L&T conglomerate. Only a few years ago, I was actually dreaming of applying and working in MindTree as I'd heard a lot about its reputation.
  
    If all startups end up being captured by larger companies like this, there won't be any diversity in the next 1-2 decades. Only a few large oligarchs like Infosys, TCS, L&T, etc. will thrive in the market.
  
    Is this what capitalism and free market economy means? I don't think so. People should be worried about this phenomenon irrespective of your core ideology (left/right wing, libertarian/liberal/conservative, etc.).
  
    People working at Infosys, etc. definitely won't care because they are getting their paychecks and ensuring competition in the markets isn't their job. But what is the CCI (Competition Commission of India) doing? Isn't it their job to prevent these kinds of acquisitions and to ensure that competition prevails in the Indian Economy? Are those guys sleeping or just pretending to be asleep?

    Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (KRIDE) on December 30 issued a Letter of Acceptance (LoA) to Larsen & Toubro for the civil work of the 46-km Kanaka Line (Heelalige – Rajanukunte) in the Bengaluru suburban rail project. The contract is worth Rs 1,040 crore.
  
    Earlier, L&T was awarded the work for Corridor-2 (Chikkabanavara to Byappanahalli for 25.2 km), and construction activities are underway.
  
    ""With this tender award, a total length of 72.08 km of Civil work (elevated and at-grade) for BSRP has been awarded, covering approximately 50 percent of the total project alignment. Corridor 2 (Chikkabanavara to Byappanahalli) and Corridor 4 (Heelalige – Rajanukunte) were identified as phase-1 priority corridors by the Karnataka government,"" said a statement from KRIDE.
  
    In October 2020, the Union government approved the 149-km suburban rail project with four corridors. While the Union government sanctioned the suburban rail project in October 2020 with a completion time of six years (by 2026), Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who laid the foundation stone in June 2022, stated that the project, first mooted in 1983, would be completed in 40 months.

"Bharatmala project: Adani-led consortium, BJP donors, firm with BJP links get tenders in breach of norms","
    
    At least one Adani Transport-led consortium, one firm with alleged BJP links, and four companies that donated to the BJP have been awarded road construction projects under the first phase of the central government’s Bharatmala Pariyojana.
  
    And a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General found irregularities in the awardments to all these companies.
  
    For example, the consortium led by Adani Transport is Suryapet Khammam Road Private Ltd. It was awarded a project to four-lane the national highway between Suryapet and Khammam in Telangana under the hybrid annuity model. The company did not fulfil the requisite condition of having experience in construction work in the highway sector.
  
    Then there’s the case of PNR Infotech, an infrastructure company promoted by Naveen Jain, a BJP leader. PNR Infotech was awarded the contract of package 1 of Lucknow Ring Road in August 2019 at 17.44 percent higher cost than originally estimated. The bid cost even exceeded the revised estimates by 2.02 percent. At the time, Jain was mayor of Agra.
  
    Similarly, the CAG report documents irregularities with four companies – IRB Infrastructure Developers, J Kumar Infraprojects, Larsen & Toubro, and MKC Infrastructure Ltd – that had donated a cumulative amount of over Rs 77 crore to the BJP between 2013 and 2021.

    What's the best infrastructure sector mutual fund for India? (Couldn't find a similar thread on this) The Invesco India Infrastructure and BOI AXA Manufacturing & Infrastructure seem highly rated. Although I prefer the former for the higher exposure to Larsen & Toubro, the latter has had a much higher historical return.

I am color blind and depressed.,"
    
    I am an engineering student and I just found out that I am colorblind ( color deficient in red-green hues to be more precise). I wanted to get an engineering job just after graduation through placement but I have found out that many companies reject color deficient people like Reliance , Larsen and Toubro etc. PSUs like JSPL, ONGC, HPCL, Delhi Metro etc. also reject color deficient candidates. Indian Engineering Services, Railways also reject color deficient candidates. The Government of India does not recognize Color Blindness as a disability. I am depressed because I don't know what I will be able to do after graduation. As I come from a relatively poorer background(lower middle class), my topmost priority is to get a good job after graduation but everything seems impossible.
  
    I am sorry if someone doesn't understand my post. English is not my first language. I just want to know if there are options for a person like me in Indian job market.

India secures aerospace contracts for MiG-29 aircraft engines and BrahMos missiles,"
    
    In a significant move toward self-reliance in defense under the ""Aatmanirbharta in Defence"" initiative and to further promote the Make-in-India program, the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has signed five major defense acquisition contracts totaling approximately $5 billion USD. Among these contracts, one was signed with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the acquisition of aero-engines for MiG-29 aircraft, two with Larsen & Toubro Limited for the purchase of Close-in Weapon Systems (CIWS) and High-Power Radars (HPR), and two more with BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL) for the procurement of BrahMos missiles and ship-borne BrahMos systems for the Indian Defense Forces.
   
     
        
      
    The BrahMos missile, a joint venture between India's Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya, is a medium-range ramjet supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or a transporter erector launcher (Picture source: Brahmos Aerospace)

New Navy ships to be built in Titanic shipyard under £1.6bn contract,"
    
    New Royal Navy vessels are to be built at the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was built over 100 years ago in a boost for the British shipbuilding industry.
  
    An Anglo-Spanish consortium, which includes the Northern Irish shipyard Harland & Wolff, has been handed the Government contract to build support ships. Final assembly will be done at the Belfast yard where the Titanic was constructed between 1908 and 1912.
  
    The contract has been awarded to Team Resolute, which includes designer BMT, Harland & Wolff and Spain’s Navantia. The group fended off competition from an all-British bid from defence giants BAE Systems and Babcock, as well as an offer from Indian shipyard Larsen & Toubro.
  
    Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the deal was a “feather in the cap” for Harland & Wolff'.
  
    “Shipbuilding is coming back to Belfast,” he said during a visit to Appledore, Devon, where Harland & Wolff has a yard.
  
    Insiders at the winning firms have previously told The Telegraph that up to 60pc of the work on the ships could be undertaken in Britain. The finished vessels will provide Britain’s new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers with munitions, food and spare parts.
  
    Today, the Ministry of Defence said most of the modules for the three ships would be constructed at Harland & Wolff facilities in Belfast and Appledore. Some building work will also be done at Navantia’s yard in Cadiz.
  
    Mr Wallace said: “This news will be a significant boost to the UK shipbuilding industry.
  
    “By selecting Team Resolute, the Ministry of Defence has chosen a proposal which includes £77m of investment into the UK shipyards, creating around 2,000 UK jobs, and showcasing cutting-edge British design.”
  
    Unions have previously voiced concern that not all the work would be done in Britain despite considerable expertise in the country.
  
    However, the Harland & Wolff-led team said 1,200 UK shipyard jobs will be created, while the contract will support a further 800 jobs at suppliers and 200 apprentices.
  
    Harland & Wolff has gone from receiving petitions from HMRC over unpaid tax bills to landing major defence contracts within a space of months.
  
    HMRC petitioned to have a subsidiary of the company wound up in June over an alleged unpaid bill of £92,275.
  
    It then won a £55m contract to overhaul minesweeper vessels for the Lithuanian navy.
  
    The firm was also in the running to build the new Royal Yacht until the plan was scrapped this month.
  
    John Wood, chief executive of Harland & Wolff, said: “Team Resolute will be making a significant investment into the UK and help to level up UK Government defence spend across the whole Union. We will create high quality UK jobs, apprenticeships and four facilities across the UK which will have shipbuilding capabilities fit for the 21st century.”

Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigns as chairman of Paytm Payments Bank;,"
    
    Good morning, everyone!
  
    Let's kick off today with some news:
  
    Firstly, from Paytm:
  
    Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of Paytm, has resigned as non-executive chairman and board member of its payments bank unit amid a board revamp. This decision comes in response to regulatory actions, with Sharma stepping down due to the RBI's crackdown on the payments bank for repeated non-compliance. As part of this restructuring, Paytm Payments Bank Limited has reconstituted its board, and Sharma has relinquished his role as part-time non-executive chairman.
  
    Moving on, from Asian Paints:
  
    Asian Paints' Shares Decline: Asian Paints shares have dropped by 4%, reaching a low of ₹2,847.8 apiece on the NSE.
  
    Reason for Decline: The decline is attributed to concerns about increased competition in the decorative paints segment.
  
    Rating Downgrade Impact: A recent rating downgrade by foreign brokerage CLSA from 'Underperform' to 'Sell', with a target price cut of 24.57% to ₹2,425, may have contributed to the decline.
  
    Market Reaction: This marks the second consecutive day of decline for Asian Paints, with shares falling as much as 4.63%, hitting their lowest level since April 28, 2023.
  
    Lastly, from L&T:
  
    According to recent reports, L&T leads the Nifty 50 gainers as markets start the week in the red. Here's why:
  
    Market Performance: Despite overall market downturns, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) emerged as a top gainer in the Nifty 50 index.
  
    Investor Interest: L&T's performance could be attributed to factors such as strong financials, positive investor sentiment, or specific company news.
  
    Sectoral Impact: The performance of L&T might reflect broader trends within its sector or the market as a whole.
  
    Investor Confidence: L&T's performance could signal investor confidence in the company's prospects and management.
  
    Market Analysis: Analysts might interpret L&T's gains in the context of industry dynamics, economic indicators, or corporate developments.
  
    Long-term Outlook: While short-term gains are notable, investors may consider the long-term growth potential and strategic positioning of L&T in their investment decisions.

    Then Wat took place followed by watson glaser test. The topic for wat how social media's downside can be dealt with. Time alloted for WAT was 20 minutes (it's literally a Google form which you have to fill and submit in 20 min) and Watson Glaser was 30 minutes (you'll probably complete it in max 20 minutes. Its very easy).
  
    Now for PI they had divided all among groups of 12. They made 4-5 groups sit in one room and were calling one by one for the interview.
  
    Interview panel- 1 male (M) in his late 50s or early 60s. 1 female (F) age around 35.
  
    The entire interview lasted around 5 minutes. (for the guy before me it was 8 minutes). I never met anyone whose interview lasted for 10 or more minutes.
  
    M: so you don't have work experience. Me : No sir. I do have 18 months of work ex. F: He does. I think you are seeing the wrong form. M pulls out the right one. M: so you worked in larsen and toubro. What one thing you liked about it? Me: told M: Any person there that you admire Me : told M: Any senior person? Me : told the name of CEO itself. I had met him once. M: okay, why MBA? Me: told Talked about my long term goal. Talked about my experience in business analytics during this answer. F: We also have business analytics program. Have you applied for it? Me: Yes M: Where do you see yourself in 5 years. Me :told.
  
    M: okay. That's all. F: Thank you. I said thank you and left thinking ye kya bakchodi tha.
  
    No GK. No specialization related anything, no why nmims, no graduation related.
  
    On the top of it, the weightage for interview is only 10%.
  
    Nmat-60%🤯 WAT(that Google form) - 10% Watson-Glaser - 10% PI-10% Academics - 5% Workex-5% (lol)
  
    About college.. Infrastructure is amazing. Kya building thi🤯.. Kya auditorium tha🤯.. Kya launde aur laundiya thi🥵🥵
  
    I personally felt that they called in itni sari janta just to try to impress them and parents with their infrastructure and lifts (yes I'm talking about the elevator that takes you up and down) . Attaching the photo I clicked there. Also while the person was giving instructions he said ""plz do not click pictures till your interview is done. I know it's difficult not to but control yourself but try to focus on you pi first"" lmao.
  
    Placement wise I do not trust the clg. It's a private college and I saw some screenshots of placement cell asking unplaced students to opt out of placement drives to show a good avg and median ctcs on placement report. But I feel as long as you are among top 10-20% of the students (profile wise, academic wise, work ex wise) then I think you will sail through.
  
    Fees bohot jyada he. Mumbai me Rehne khane ka kharcha alag. I think you are gonna spend around 33-35 lacs in 2 years. Are you gonna get a 30 lpa job there? Probability is very less. But I feel (or hope) that there are decent chances of getting around 20-25 lpa. Current or past NMIMS mumbai students plz correct me if I'm wrong.
  
    Aur baki kya tha?
  
    Ha.. Don't eat clg ke just bahar ka paneer frankie. I ate one. It was terrible. Don't know about vada pav but frankie was shit. Also eat well before you go to the clg. Pura din me sirf ek samosa diya. And chai. I tried taking 2 samosas and us bkl ne bola sir ek hi lena. I bolne wala tha clg walon ne interview lene ke 1000 liye he. But nai bola.
  
    Okay bye.. Mera boss 3 baar ghoor ke gya.. me phn pe hu. 👋✌️

North American Low Voltage DC Circuit Breaker Market to Witness Astonishing Growth by 2029,"
    
    North American low voltage DC circuit breaker market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period. North America has significant market growth owing to the rising installation of solar panels, significant automobile sector, and high adoption of renewable energy. In North America, particularly in the US, there are numerous programs which are promoting the growth of the market. Solar power production incentive act 1990 is an amendment to the PURPA of 1978 and the Federal Power Act. The main purpose is to remove the size limitations placed on renewable energy facilities, such as solar and wind, in order to receive PURPA benefits. This will encourage the development of renewable energy production, thereby encouraging the installation of solar panels in the near future. This, in turn, is expected to propel the deployment rate of low voltage DC circuit breakers as solar panels are connected in series circuits, and one installation may have one or more circuits as per its capacity. The circuits are connected to a PV combiner box, where each is protected by a DC circuit breaker.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigns as chairman of Paytm Payments Bank;,"
    
    Good morning, everyone!
  
    Let's kick off today with some news:
  
    Firstly, from Paytm:
  
    Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of Paytm, has resigned as non-executive chairman and board member of its payments bank unit amid a board revamp. This decision comes in response to regulatory actions, with Sharma stepping down due to the RBI's crackdown on the payments bank for repeated non-compliance. As part of this restructuring, Paytm Payments Bank Limited has reconstituted its board, and Sharma has relinquished his role as part-time non-executive chairman.
  
    Moving on, from Asian Paints:
  
      
    
    Asian Paints' Shares Decline: Asian Paints shares have dropped by 4%, reaching a low of ₹2,847.8 apiece on the NSE.
  
  
    
    Reason for Decline: The decline is attributed to concerns about increased competition in the decorative paints segment.
  
  
    
    Rating Downgrade Impact: A recent rating downgrade by foreign brokerage CLSA from 'Underperform' to 'Sell', with a target price cut of 24.57% to ₹2,425, may have contributed to the decline.
  
  
    
    Market Reaction: This marks the second consecutive day of decline for Asian Paints, with shares falling as much as 4.63%, hitting their lowest level since April 28, 2023.
  
  
    
    Lastly, from L&T:
  
    According to recent reports, L&T leads the Nifty 50 gainers as markets start the week in the red. Here's why:
  
      
    
    Market Performance: Despite overall market downturns, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) emerged as a top gainer in the Nifty 50 index.
  
  
    
    Investor Interest: L&T's performance could be attributed to factors such as strong financials, positive investor sentiment, or specific company news.
  
  
    
    Sectoral Impact: The performance of L&T might reflect broader trends within its sector or the market as a whole.
  
  
    
    Investor Confidence: L&T's performance could signal investor confidence in the company's prospects and management.
  
  
    
    Market Analysis: Analysts might interpret L&T's gains in the context of industry dynamics, economic indicators, or corporate developments.
  
  
    
    Long-term Outlook: While short-term gains are notable, investors may consider the long-term growth potential and strategic positioning of L&T in their investment decisions.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigns as chairman of Paytm Payments Bank;,"
    
    Good morning, everyone!
  
    Let's kick off today with some news:
  
    Firstly, from Paytm:
  
    Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of Paytm, has resigned as non-executive chairman and board member of its payments bank unit amid a board revamp. This decision comes in response to regulatory actions, with Sharma stepping down due to the RBI's crackdown on the payments bank for repeated non-compliance. As part of this restructuring, Paytm Payments Bank Limited has reconstituted its board, and Sharma has relinquished his role as part-time non-executive chairman.
  
    Moving on, from Asian Paints:
  
      
    
    Asian Paints' Shares Decline: Asian Paints shares have dropped by 4%, reaching a low of ₹2,847.8 apiece on the NSE.
  
  
    
    Reason for Decline: The decline is attributed to concerns about increased competition in the decorative paints segment.
  
  
    
    Rating Downgrade Impact: A recent rating downgrade by foreign brokerage CLSA from 'Underperform' to 'Sell', with a target price cut of 24.57% to ₹2,425, may have contributed to the decline.
  
  
    
    Market Reaction: This marks the second consecutive day of decline for Asian Paints, with shares falling as much as 4.63%, hitting their lowest level since April 28, 2023.
  
  
    
    Lastly, from L&T:
  
    According to recent reports, L&T leads the Nifty 50 gainers as markets start the week in the red. Here's why:
  
      
    
    Market Performance: Despite overall market downturns, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) emerged as a top gainer in the Nifty 50 index.
  
  
    
    Investor Interest: L&T's performance could be attributed to factors such as strong financials, positive investor sentiment, or specific company news.
  
  
    
    Sectoral Impact: The performance of L&T might reflect broader trends within its sector or the market as a whole.
  
  
    
    Investor Confidence: L&T's performance could signal investor confidence in the company's prospects and management.
  
  
    
    Market Analysis: Analysts might interpret L&T's gains in the context of industry dynamics, economic indicators, or corporate developments.
  
  
    
    Long-term Outlook: While short-term gains are notable, investors may consider the long-term growth potential and strategic positioning of L&T in their investment decisions.

"Larsen & Toubro Ltd. ; Target - 2,475; Duration - 3 Months","
    
    Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (L&T) is a prominent Engineering & Construction (E&C) company in India, with a strong reputation for successfully executing complex infrastructure projects. The company holds significant stakes in IT firms like L&T Technology Services and LTI Mindtree, with ownership percentages of 73.9% and 68.7% respectively, as of March 2023.
  
    One of the key investment rationales for L&T is its focus on the asset-light Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) segment. In recent years, the company has strategically exited non-core businesses and reduced its exposure to road HAMs. This shift has led to an improved asset turnover ratio, which has risen from 2.6x in FY15 to 4.3x in FY23. By adopting an asset-light approach, L&T aims to enhance its operational efficiency and profitability.
  
    L&T boasts a robust order book, amounting to Rs 4 trillion as of March 2023. This order book is 2.2 times the company's consolidated sales for FY23, ensuring healthy revenue visibility in the near term. Additionally, L&T achieved a strong order inflow growth of 19% YoY, amounting to over Rs 2 trillion, during FY22. These positive developments indicate the company's ability to secure new projects and sustain its growth trajectory.
  
    The management has provided guidance for FY24, anticipating a consolidated order inflow growth rate of approximately 10-12%. They also project a revenue growth rate of 12-15%. Regarding margins, L&T expects a year-on-year improvement of 40-50 basis points to 9% in the Projects and Manufacturing business segment, which contributes around 50% of the company's consolidated revenues.
  
    Looking ahead, L&T has identified three key sectors for its focus over the next five years. Firstly, EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) projects are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11-13%. Secondly, high-tech manufacturing, including heavy engineering and defense, is likely to witness a CAGR of 12-14%. Lastly, services, including IT services, are anticipated to achieve a CAGR of 20-25%. Overall, L&T aims to achieve a target of 14% revenue CAGR over the next 4-5 years, accompanied by a return on equity (RoE) of 18%.
  
    L&T's performance in FY23 was commendable, with consolidated revenue, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), and PAT (Profit After Tax) experiencing year-on-year growth rates of 1.3%, 7%, and 21% respectively. The consolidated EBITDA margin at the group level saw a slight decline of 30 basis points YoY, reaching 11.3%. However, the RoE improved to 12.2% in FY23, up from 11.0% in FY22. Considering the company's healthy order book position, the current stock valuation appears attractive, with the stock trading at a 1-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.1x, which is below historical averages.
  
    In summary, Larsen & Toubro Ltd. is a leading E&C company in India with a strong track record in executing complex infrastructure projects. By focusing on the asset-light HAM segment, maintaining a robust order book, and providing positive guidance for FY24 and beyond, L&T aims to achieve sustainable growth. The company's decent performance in FY23, combined with attractive valuation, makes it an appealing investment opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on India's infrastructure development.

"Ugro Capital - Deep Dive: On valuations, NBFCs, and the start of something beautiful.","
    
    There are two circumstances for an investor that drive wealth creation: the growth of the company, and the valuation (P/E) multiples that the market gives your company.
  
      
    
    If your company grows at 10% a year, and the P/E remains constant, you make a return based solely on growth.
  
  
    
    If your company doesn't generate a growth in sales, but the market awards it a higher multiple, you make returns based on re-rating.
  
  
    
    Maximum wealth creation happens when both of these occur.
  
  
    
    Some quick examples:
  
    Note that these charts display the valuation, not the stock price.
  
    
  
    Astral Polytechnik is a prime example of a case where the P/E remained constant.
  
      
    
    Astral Poly Technik has traded at almost a constant multiple of 52 P/E since 2014, and in this time went from a share price of ~200 to a share price of ~800 in March 2020 based on growth, before seeing a re-rating event.
  
  
    
    
  
    Larsen and Toubro trading at a historical discount
  
    2) Larsen is an example that's currently trading at a discount to historic valuations, and is a candidate for re-rating, considering the numerous IT companies it owns.
  
    
  
    Asian Paints - Growth + Re-rating
  
    3) Asian Paints has generated huge returns over the years because both these events are true. It consistently grows its sales, and has had numerous re-rating events.
  
    Today, the deep dive is on a small cap that has the potential to grow massively over the next 3 years, and is trading at attractive valuations, leaving an investor open to re-rating events. This is not a buy recommendation.
  
    
  
    
  
    Ugro's story begins over a decade ago with Religare. Religare was an NBFC / Finserv company founded by the infamous Singh brothers. If you're unfamiliar with them, they were the promoters of Ranbaxy, and were responsible for creating a culture of large scale corporate fraud. They used Religare to embezzle money by giving loans to shell companies owned in their name, and then defaulted on the payments, making shareholders pay.
  
    Now the NBFC side of Religare was spearheaded by a man named Mr. Nath, who was responsible for growing the loan book from less than 1000 crores to over 10,000 crores during his tenure. However, his hard work was undone by the corporate culture of fraud, and after sinking years into this company, Mr. Nath quit, citing bad corporate governance.
  
    The scams then came to light, and a few years later, the Singh brothers and their key beneficiaries were arrested. Mr. Nath decided to start over, creating his own company and assembling a fantastic management team. This company doesn't have criminals promoting it, and has such smart policies in place that marquee investors such as Sunil Singhania's Abakkus Fund, and Madhusudan Kela decided to back it. The joke is that Ugro is currently available cheaper than what they paid for it.
  
    
  
    Management and Governance
  
    
  
      
    
    Read through Ugro's management team and board of directors, every single person working for them has 15-40 years of experience at various leading banks. They've brought in ex directors from RBI, SEBI, the regional branch head of HDFC. The takeaway is that they should be expected to stay far ahead of policy changes, they're taking compliance seriously, and have brought people in that have experience in making huge institutions.
  
  
    
    The investor presentation sheds light on framework that would have prevented the scams at Religare. They also have someone from Yes Bank for their insight on preventing mismanagement.
  
  
    
    
  
    Governance framework at Ugro
  
    
  
    Lending Universe
  
    Ugro's lending universe
  
    This has lead to a lending universe where they face relatively low competition. They aren't competing in the housing space, they aren't competing with vehicle financiers, but have carved a niche. What's immediately amazing is that they've started out with a diverse geography mix.
  
    
  
    Diversification
  
    NBFCs usually struggle with this. You have players like Aavas and Muthoot that are heavily reliant on one state. CreditAccess Grameen has slowly managed to de-risk through inorganic acquisitions. Only a few like Bajaj Finance have managed to be truly national players. This is a promising start for Ugro.
  
    Their business model has three highlights. The first is that they use data analytics to come up with a Scorecard for each loan. The second is their ability to use tech in a way to increase sales channels and disburse loans much faster than other banks and NBFCs. The third is their model of co-origination lending which is a masterpiece.
  
    
  
    Co-Origination
  
    Lastly, for an NBFC, you want to see a diverse liability mix. An over dependence on term loans is a sign that mutual funds and insurance companies don't trust you. Over time, NBFCs try to obtain their liabilities through non convertible debentures. Ugro's mix is something most companies dream about.
  
    
  
    Liability mix
  
    
  
    It'll be a key monitorable going forward, whether they're able to maintain these ratios as their disbursals increase.
  
    Investment Thesis
  
    
  
      
    
    While other NBFCs have been restructuring their loan books during covid, Ugro is clean and poised. They have a reserve of roughly 900 crores, ready to scale up their operations as needed.
  
  
    
    The management knows how to grow the loan book and has done it before. Their goal is to have disbursals of 20,000 crores (10x) in the next five years.
  
  
    
    Name another micro-cap that uses any of the Big 4 as auditors, RBI/SEBI directors and people with 30-40 years of experience.
  
  
    
    Adoption of digital methods of sales/disbursals and embracing technology / analytics driven lending.
  
  
    
    Available cheaper than book value of 135.
  
  
    
    Timely disclosures, already doing earnings calls and presentations.
  
  
    
    Key Risks
  
    
  
      
    
    NBFCs need to prove themselves. Ugro is new, and that's the biggest risk. We won't be able to say anything about asset quality until they have a track record of a few years. This means we're basing our expectations on the management, and what the company looks like on paper. This story will take years to play out and has to be constantly monitored; one cannot switch off.
  
  
    
    Stock trades only on the BSE, and volumes are somewhat illiquid, having a 50 day average volume of 16,000.
  
  
    
    
  
    Final Takeaway: Ask yourself if this kind of quality (on paper) is something you see everyday in a sub 1000 crore market cap company. Then do your own research to arrive at an investment decision.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigns as chairman of Paytm Payments Bank;,"
    
    Good morning, everyone!
  
    Let's kick off today with some news:
  
    Firstly, from Paytm:
  
    Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of Paytm, has resigned as non-executive chairman and board member of its payments bank unit amid a board revamp. This decision comes in response to regulatory actions, with Sharma stepping down due to the RBI's crackdown on the payments bank for repeated non-compliance. As part of this restructuring, Paytm Payments Bank Limited has reconstituted its board, and Sharma has relinquished his role as part-time non-executive chairman.
  
    Moving on, from Asian Paints:
  
      
    
    Asian Paints' Shares Decline: Asian Paints shares have dropped by 4%, reaching a low of ₹2,847.8 apiece on the NSE.
  
  
    
    Reason for Decline: The decline is attributed to concerns about increased competition in the decorative paints segment.
  
  
    
    Rating Downgrade Impact: A recent rating downgrade by foreign brokerage CLSA from 'Underperform' to 'Sell', with a target price cut of 24.57% to ₹2,425, may have contributed to the decline.
  
  
    
    Market Reaction: This marks the second consecutive day of decline for Asian Paints, with shares falling as much as 4.63%, hitting their lowest level since April 28, 2023.
  
  
    
    Lastly, from L&T:
  
    According to recent reports, L&T leads the Nifty 50 gainers as markets start the week in the red. Here's why:
  
      
    
    Market Performance: Despite overall market downturns, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) emerged as a top gainer in the Nifty 50 index.
  
  
    
    Investor Interest: L&T's performance could be attributed to factors such as strong financials, positive investor sentiment, or specific company news.
  
  
    
    Sectoral Impact: The performance of L&T might reflect broader trends within its sector or the market as a whole.
  
  
    
    Investor Confidence: L&T's performance could signal investor confidence in the company's prospects and management.
  
  
    
    Market Analysis: Analysts might interpret L&T's gains in the context of industry dynamics, economic indicators, or corporate developments.
  
  
    
    Long-term Outlook: While short-term gains are notable, investors may consider the long-term growth potential and strategic positioning of L&T in their investment decisions.

What's your long term view on L&T?,"
    
    With the strong focus on infrastructural development in India, L&T seems positioned for further rise. It also has significant operations in Gulf and with the EU-Gulf-India corridor beinh proposed, chances are that L&T would bag huge orders if the proposal sees the daylight. Finally, L&T taps into defence structure as well. I mean the company is a large cap with huge market cap, but I still think that in the long term, the stock can multiply. What's your viewpoint?

"[RANT] Should I quit Larsen and Toubro ""The company that built India""??","
    
    TLDR: Disillusioned with the actual work being done inside L&T, alloted job which will not build relevant experience for me and debating whether i should leave after observing the slow beauracracy, poor equipment and work culture.
  
    L&T came to our campus for placement in the middle of 7th semseter and after clearing their 3 rounds of interview and health test, they ghosted me, around march they got back saying that i am selected and requested me to update data on their internal tracking system with the usual WITCH stuff, marksheets for all semesters, 10th and 12th marksheets, and the usual fare. After that they again went radio silent. In mid June, I finally received the offer letter which specified that I was alloted Heavy Engineering IC and i was to be deployed to a remote location. The pay is 6LPA CTC (36k inhand per month).
  
    The joining was conducted soon and we spent 3 days in a 5 star facility post which we were told to report at our respective alloted locations. At our location we spent like two weeks during which we visited the workshops and saw what was being done. We were subsequently alloted our departments. They make you apply for NATS, which is a government scheme through which they get like 3 lakh inr from the government, they make you sign a document which basically says you're a retard, totally incapable of understanding or doing anything, a piece of shit not worth employing and so they are training you to become "" employable"". I was deployed to a remote corner of India where it is always raining, half the time the electricity is down, the mobile network is dogshit and is a small town with just the basic necessities with half the population of the town being composed of L&T employees. I was alloted the accounting group (As an EC graduate, yes!) and as such, i got to go through a few contracts, you wouldn't believe the margins they are booking!
  
    Regarding Technical Expertise, L&T is literal dogshit, they just put stuff together like legos. All the parts are bought from other contractors and are just assembled together like legos with a reference blueprint which is also sent by the client. They basically collect orders from large institutions, divvy the mechanical and electrical systems seperately, and outsource it. Most of the stuff is purchased from companies like Ashok Leyland, general electric, Volvo, Tata, etc. for electronics they bought stuff from third party integrators who sold them the complete system as opposed to doing it themselves coz ""it simplified the manufacturing"". These companies are having a field day selling 100rs. worth stuff to L&T for 10,000rs. All manufacturing lines seems to be atleast 6 months behind the delivery schedule, angry customer reps would show up or call everday to ensure their project is prioritised and delivered asap. What L&T does is basically ""screwdriver technolgy"", just buy stuff in modules and plug/screw/rivet it in. They do not even have a proper warehouse to store their stuff. They bring in their metal structures and just unload it on a grass patch, the structures get wet by rain and develop rusting, then they fit the same rusted structures and just paint it over ( they do have a really good painting facility, gotta give them that) and pretend the rust was never there, they dont bother removing it as it basically gets hidden under the thick coats of paint, its the buyer's hedache to deal with later.
  
    The work computers are slow as hell, they are still runing 3rd gen core i3/i5 pcs across their organisation with 500 gig hardrives and 4 gb ram, it takes them a good 15 mins just to boot up and load up the relavant work software, some of the monitors have spots or lines and spares aren't available. There is a saftey depatment here, but its just for show, they basically spend their day loitering in the office, he is just there to claim compliance with some international standards. In reality he is powerless to enforce these standards, if he tries to do it, he gets scolded by other departments as following proper procedures delays the manufacturing even more. Don't even get me started on the ""state of the art manufacturing"", the bulk of the work is still being done manually, with each item being riveted/installed manually by a person, when it could also be done on an assembly line, because its cheaper. Whenever something goes wrong, its all about playing the blame game and passing the buck with little to no interest in actually trying to fix the issue.
  
    Work life balance is basically non existent. 7am to 6pm are the regular working hours and there is no paid overtime, workdays are monday to saturday. It is basically go to work, work, come back from work, sleep, go to work. You are left with little to no time to pursue your hobbies/ prepare for career/ just chill out, not that there is much to do here in the middle of nowhere in a small town. They have an alarming 70% attrition rate for fresh grads with most people leaving within a year. The seniors also advised us to keep looking for jobs and to exit asap if you care about your career.  I have nothing against my boss, he is a really chill dude and helpful guy, but he is kinda powerless and everything needs to be done through some internal software, which is old, outdated and buggy af, their internal software looks like its from 2005. The HR department is really passive and don't seem invested in solving your issues, a coworker of mine has been trying to get a reimbursement for over 4 months which got held up due to some glitch in their system. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem. Employees are often left without recourse or solutions to their problems.
  
    I think i am slowly losing both my health and sanity, i have suffered from fever and light dysentery as well as sleepless nights wondering if it even worth it to stay and compromise on life just for work. They have a one month notice period now and 3 month for permanent employees.

    I quit L&T 3 months back and i have not received my final month's salary.

You can read up more on my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/176qzq7/larsen_and_toubro_withholding_fnf_salary/
  
    November 1 came and went and the amount did not get credited. I sent several emails and finally i got a response. they updated the payslip and are now demanding money from me.
  
    Previous payslip (amount payable Rs. 12177)
   
     
        
      
    

  
    New Payslip (amount payable Rs. -5952)
  
    
   
     
        
      
    
  
    they are now demanding Rs. 6k from me by simply editing the notice pay recovery field. At the time of quitting i was told the recovery would be made on my basic salary for the notice period month which is one month on the number of days i am not serving. I served for 16 days for that month and opted to buy out the remaining 14 days. First they kept me waiting around for 3 months and now they are trying to fk me over and asking for money from me. My basic salary was 15.5k.

Why L&T metro sucks? (Based on another post),"
    
    This is a situation of perverse incentive in action.
  
    L&T metro doesn't make money by transporting people. Ticket prices are a big issue. If they increase it to cover costs it will become a big political issue. Infact they loose money on operation of the trains
  
    So they generate revenue on ads & store rent. This runs on full steam.
  
    So the best way to maximize revenue is reduce the frequency of the trains.
  
    A good metro should have a train every 2 mins. Singapore, Tokyo, London all try for 2 minutes.
  
    L&T will make you wait 15 mins for a train.
  
    Source https://m.timesofindia.com/city/hyderabad/poor-frequency-bad-infra-hit-metro-green-line-footfall/articleshow/101622573.cms
  
    This does 2 things
  
    First less operational costs becoz less trains to run.
  
    Second, Increased rental and ad revenue. You can show advertisers train station and compartments are jam packed with thick crowds
  
    Rental income will increase. In few years rental cost for a store in Ameerpet station will be more than a store in Banjara hills. I mean you are more likely to buy a thickshake if you are bored waiting 15 mins for the next train than if you are to board a train in 2 mins.
  
    All incentives are aligned for reducing the frequency of trains as much as possible and increasing crowds.

LONG TERM STOCK IDEA: L&T,"
    
    I've technically analysed L&T's stock in the longer time-frame of 1M. I could find a pattern that I'm going to share. This pattern would help you to capture atleast 30% returns in a max span of 2 years and the minimum of even 5 months!
  
    Idea: Supertrend's red line will act as the support/resistance. Once the candle breaks the resistance from below with an increased volume (volume bar must be green), then enter the stock for 30% returns. The entering points have been marked on the chart shared. The stock's CMP is ₹1424 right now. Wait for the opportunity to capture the next move which is quite near I believe since the stock is trading near the support drawn. Sustaining above the support with green increased volume is the key!

"Engineering graduates of /r/india: Be very, very careful if L&T recruit you. The company has a typical lala attitude and there is no accountability, safety or ethics. Despite the ads, L&T is a terrible, terrible company to work for. Don't join, leave if you can and spread the message!","
    
    Created from throwaway for obvious reasons.
  Starting point
    Fifth semester of engineering college in India. L&T are usually among the first companies to arrive on the average campus for interviews. There is usually the funda where once a student has a job offer, he or she is not allowed to attend subsequent interviews. Well, four other people and I were all selected by Larsen & Toubro. Ok. We were ecstatic. Then came the shock of the starting package which was barely touching 3 lakhs a year. Ok, we swallowed that when professors and senior students told us that L&T was a great place to start your career. Fine. This was compared to 5+ for several other companies. While at this point in your career, you need the organisation more than the organisation needs you, it must be said that humans, especially college students, will compare salaries. This is the starting point that produces disgruntled employees. Money, while not the sole factor, is important.
  
    Next came the recession. Mid way through the seventh semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they might not be able to recruit everyone and that we should start looking for alternate opportunities. This is almost a year after the original offer, by which time other large corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left high and dry with no guaranteed employment. Ok. Making the best of the situation, I searched hard and found jobs at three difference companies. A month into the job, i get a call from L&T stating that I could be offered a job the next month. Ok. Being naive and not too satisfied with my present job, i decided to take the offer. So i join, along with everyone else who was originally recruited. Excellent news so far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. I was assigned to their office in Gujarat. I must mention that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding name was assigned some or the other department in Powai, Mumbai. Ok, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty part. I ended up at a department rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions by doing whatever the boss asked for. I wasn't prepared to do this mostly because of morals. Unfortunately, i had neither wisdom nor age on my side which led to some needless confrontations with the management.
  
    Now L&T have this Management Trainee program where they put all the graduate recruits through a series of tests and interviews to determine whom to put on the MT program. In my department of 200 odd employees, we were 17 GETs (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written test round. Of the six who got through, five left the organisation within two years. Only one remains. This illustrated one thing to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  General Work
    Now, about work. Accusations were flying thick and fast right from the start about how regionalism and favouritism were rampant. Examples were cited. How much truth there was in these accusations, i cannot say. What i did observe was a persistent culture of ass licking. The boss is always right. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss must be worshipped. I did not subscribe to this school of thought and i made my views clear. I challenged my boss' views openly but politely. He did not take kindly to it. I only discovered this later.
  
    About work, L&T is basically a large contractor taking tech from abroad and just installing it in india. There is often little expertise that they actually contribute despite what the ads tell you. This was true in my department. Others, i cannot comment on. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from upper management. L&T has numerous internal companies manufacturing different pieces of equipment. The pressure was often to award contracts to these people instead of better quality and cheaper alternatives from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later when equipment was installed and found defective or just badly designed.
  Time pressures
    Everything had to be done in advance of contracted deadlines even if this meant storing sensitive equipment in the open at the mercy of the elements. No matter that the person who agreed to the deadlines had no actual idea how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to equipment being dispatched in pieces which were often not labelled and which were hard to reassemble later.
  Safety
    This existed as a token person claiming to be a safety officer on a construction site. The reality was that he was just there to claim compliance with some international standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything about blatant safety violations on a construction site. To name a few, daily wage labourers were found working with no fire safety equipment when welding and often inhaling dangerous fumes. Safety harnesses were often tattered and old. Mind you, this is from a company bidding for international contracts and i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    If you work at one of larsen & toubro's construction sites, your life is fucked. I am not saying this lightly. You work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""site allowance"". Facilities for accommodation will be terrible to begin with and will only improve should employees protest. Then too, improvements will be grudgingly made. The clients are infinitely more important than the employees. We were made to arrive at work at 0830 and leave at 1930. That is eleven hours, six days a week. Employees at the office in Gujarat got alternate saturdays off. We were not afforded this luxury because you know, you're our bitch. No recreation facilities despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The fact that were were given a ""site allowance"" was akin to asking a beggar to be satisfied with the 10 rupee note you've handed him. Taking sundays off was frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to avoid going to work on weekends.
  Performance Appraisals
    based on a normal distribution. I am not joking. Every department has to abide by this. This resulted in people working their asses off at a construction site being told that their work was under par because someone had to be in that category while people chilling in the office making power point presentations were told that their work was fantastic. More often than not, the top performers were decided based on regionalism. In a department headed by a bong, expect to see bongs as top performers.
  Employee satisfaction
    Seventeen GETs joined the company with me. I was number 14 to leave. After me, one more person left. The two that remain are still there. Every single one of my colleagues at my construction site were desperately searching for alternate jobs. Add to this the fact that GETs are treated like entitled kids while people with more experience joining the company from outside are treated like shit. This is no exaggeration. I've seen it first hand. Ask around yourself if you don't believe me. There was a Gallup survey that was conducted one year, the results of which were never made known to the employees. You can guess at the reasons.
  Pointless and Ineffective HR Practices
    Again, to claim compliance with international practices and to periodically appease employees, MANDATORY HR related courses would be forced down our throats every year. There was no choice given to employees. There did exist a system where you could choose what sort of training you wanted to receive ranging from technical to soft skills. Despite numerous requests, management just turned me down claiming that it was a waste of time. Yes, these people run the company and then wonder why people leave. Then there is the issue of bonds. Yes, every time the company invests more than a single rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a two year bond to begin with. Now, from what i hear, people are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some sort of executive training programs. Just how long the bond period is on that, i wonder.
  Racism
    Yes, it happened and it happened in the open. People were blind to it. A colleague and I were probably the only ones that noticed. The indian engineers were housed in an often muddy floored office. It was air conditioned so that was good. Anyone with white skin got a private office with their own internet connection and colour printer. The indians did not deserve either clean toilets or a colour printer or internet access. Yes, this actually happened. Caucasian people who were technician level but representing the western manufacturers of critical equipment got treatment fit for kings. Anyone indian looking, no matter which company they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The End
    After seeing numerous colleagues leave in frustration, i too threw in the towel. I was asked publicly whether i'd like to return. I answered no and was met with a stunned silence from all around me.
  Conclusions
    People leave bad managers, not companies, it is said. In the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a toxic combination of the two where your manager is powerless to fix the situation. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem. Employees are often left with recourse or solutions to their problems. The preferred way out is to leave. You can compare the attrition rates for L&T (not infotech) and the average IT company and both will be comparable. These numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.
  
    TL;DR If you're studying to become an engineer, think twice before joining Larsen & Toubro. This is my honest advice. Then again, this could be the situation in most indian engineering / contracting companies.
  Broader problems with Indian society:
    First, Indian society is not some alien thing that was handed from heaven. It rises from the particular combination of governmental form you have chosen and the pre-existing cultural norms of Indians. In the long run, ""society"" is nothing but the sum total of people logically responding to the incentives their society sets up for them.
  
    We have chosen for ourselves an overwhelmingly large state, which controls everything, and yet does nothing. The people of India, it seems to me, are forced to eke a living in the cracks and niches of the economy, while the state dominates everything.
  
    This would not be a problem if we had a decent state. But our state was set up a long time ago. Its structures were designed for a colonial master. We didn't adjust the incentives. Our government institutions and the officers within them have a psychology of the extractive colonial masters--i.e. zero sum mentality--not the mentality of a beneficient gardner or guardian.
  
    I have seen horrible thing in india. The sort of things I would expect in Charles Dickens style Victorian novels ... but in the modern day. Horrific things. Immoral things.
  
    And yet the people doing these things were not immoral or horrific. Well not in the conventional sense. They were raised up in institutions where routinely treating people worse than cattle is the culture.
  
    Where did this culture come from? I don't know the origins, but I can tell you what maintains the culture.
  
    It is the lack of accountability. And there is no accountability because people don't see a better alternative is possible. And they can't see a better alternative is possible because there is no competition.
  
    Everywhere in society there must be competition and destruction of the corrupt and old. India venerates the old too much. It venerates old institutions and culture too much. It venerates parents and religion too much. Every attempt to introduce new varieties of healthcare solutions is stymied by some combination of old government interests, old men with power, or old unions.
  
    I cannot even collect and provide blood from a private blood bank in a remote area, although maternal hemorrhage might be very common in the area. The government will make some reason about how I might give AIDS blood to patients and will stop me from doing that. Leave aside the fact that they don't provide any blood at all, and maybe some people would not mind the risk of AIDS if it means not dying ... but what about the fact that we can demonstrate that our testing is much better than government testing. It doesn't matter. They won't evaluate our testing without a bribe. And then another bribe will be necessary to take into account the fact that our test is satisfactory, etc.
  
    Why do people demand bribes? Because their salaries are pathetic. Why are the salaries pathetic? Because the institutions can pay them some pittance, and they don't have an alternative job they can choose so the salaries don't rise. Why are there no alternative jobs? Because the government dominates the economy and there is not much private enterprise to give alternative employment.
  
    The domination of 1 Billion people by one institution, with no competition cannot be a healthy thing for any society. The mighty Soviet Union collapsed trying to centralize everything. Why is India still trying Nehru's failed dream of running everything from Delhi?
  
    People think the economy and the morals are two separate things. They aren't. They are linked. Indians who leave India are as moral as any other people. Maybe a few who come directly from India are a bit immoral, but their kids become as moral as anyone else after one generation. They just respond to the fact that obeying the rules pays you abroad.
  
    In India you get punished if you play by the rules. You can't make it. Everyone around you is breaking the rules. If you are a clerk in a hospital and someone comes for medicine, and you don't ask for a bribe, maybe that means your own kids won't get a proper education ... because you have to pay for a private school after all, since the government school is garbage and anyway requires a bribe.
  
    Why are government institutions so worthless? Its because no institution can endure without corruption and calcification for an extended period of time. You have to disrupt every institution internally. For private companies this comes by way of bankruptcy, merger, or acquisition. Sometimes, the board will reorganize the company internally prior to those drastic measures ... but that's rare.
  
    Govt. of India has had ZERO shakeups and reorganizations. It's still operating like British Raj style. Have you ever gone to meet a senior IAS officer? Do you see the army of clerks waiting outside their offices. I don't mean 4 or 5 clerks. I'm telling you, there are DOZENS of clerks. Maybe hundreds. WTF are these people all doing with their monitors and keyboards? Nobody fucking knows.
  
    If you took all those salaries and gave it to one guy, he would be a decent guy and he would do decent work without a bribe. And the rest of those people could go find work in the private sector, which would grow once the government stopped raping it every day.

L&T finance is the worst of the lot,"
    
    I don’t know how they got my number. I kept getting incessant calls from their telecalling team, sometimes as many as 5 calls a day even after complaining and begging them to stop calling me. The calls reduced, but never fully stopped. My inbox is flooded with SMSes from them offering me a loan when I never required one. Today I refreshed my Cibil score and saw that it reduced by a couple of points, although there was no reason for it since I ALWAYS pay my credit card dues on time. So I went to check, and found that there is an overdraft account open in my name for 50K which I never applied for or never approved or anything.
  
    Is there anything I can do to complain about this? Has anyone else experienced this? These guys are just the scum of the earth!! I’m so frickin annoyed!

Think Larsen & Toubro is a great company with great ethics and all that rubbish? Think again.,"
    
    I  was browsing thru the sub and when I saw [HCL sending out appointment  letters after 3 years of accepting the candidate. Should be reported.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36ush4/hcl_sending_out_appointment_letters_after_3_years/) and I thought maybe you guys might be able to help us.
  
    L&T  came to our college for placements in 2014, held one of the most  toughest placement procedures lasting two days, consisting of two tests,  on GD and two interviews, selected the students and never sent them the  DOJ's. Their pay package was genuinely below par for a core company but  since we wanted a core job, we accepted their offer and so because of  college rules, we could not sit for other placements.
  
    L&T  being a core company also meant we expected them to be a little more  professional. It's been more than a year since we got selected and we  are still sitting with no date of joining. They could have simply  selected fewer students and I would have been fine with that, but then,  they selected us, and did not give us the date of joining. I know people  who have taken loans and are basically doing odd jobs like for 5-10k a  month, trying to make ends meet to pay back the loans. It is disgusting,  and it would be nothing short of fraud what they are doing.
  
    Obviously,  we as students can move on, apply else where and get on with our lives.  But there are a lot of us still waiting, doing odd jobs, waiting. I  dont know what they try to achieve by recruiting such large numbers and  keep them waiting for YEARS at end. This is wrong.
  Please upvote this for visibility.
    Okay  now a lot of you guys are insisting that we should have moved on/  should move on, and I myself mentioned that we could have, but the  problem is that at the time when you get placed, you do not know that  you are going to get screwed over, because the whole thing is hyped so  much, and they promptly send you the letters of intent, and tell you  that you might have to wait for a bit.
  
    ""A  bit"" is not one year. ""A bit"" is two to four months. Maybe six. Not a  year. Definitely not more than a year. So you wait for about 3 months  till after college gets over. During the third month, you see that all  of your friends have started working.
  
    In  the fourth month, now you are really alone. You try calling up the HR  department at the company, and they say, yes yes we will give you the  date by maximum by this month end. This has been happening for the past  one year.
  
    Now, I think a lot of you must  be knowing that once you are out of college, and the placement season is  over, it is very, very difficult to apply for a job. Also, a lot of  people want to pursue higher education/ pay back loans and this makes it  very difficult to do so.

"[Rant] The inside story on Larsen & Toubro, the supposed people responsible for building India","
    
    Created from throwaway for obvious reasons.
  Starting point
    Fifth semester of engineering college in India. L&T are usually among the first companies to arrive on the average campus for interviews. There is usually the funda where once a student has a job offer, he or she is not allowed to attend subsequent interviews. Well, four other people and I were all selected by Larsen & Toubro. Ok. We were ecstatic. Then came the shock of the starting package which was barely touching 3 lakhs a year. Ok, we swallowed that when professors and senior students told us that L&T was a great place to start your career. Fine. This was compared to 5+ for several other companies. While at this point in your career, you need the organisation more than the organisation needs you, it must be said that humans, especially college students, will compare salaries. This is the starting point that produces disgruntled employees. Money, while not the sole factor, is important.
  
    Next came the recession. Mid way through the seventh semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they might not be able to recruit everyone and that we should start looking for alternate opportunities. This is almost a year after the original offer, by which time other large corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left high and dry with no guaranteed employment. Ok. Making the best of the situation, I searched hard and found jobs at three difference companies. A month into the job, i get a call from L&T stating that I could be offered a job the next month. Ok. Being naive and not too satisfied with my present job, i decided to take the offer. So i join, along with everyone else who was originally recruited. Excellent news so far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. I was assigned to their office in Gujarat. I must mention that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding name was assigned some or the other department in Powai, Mumbai. Ok, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty part. I ended up at a department rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions by doing whatever the boss asked for. I wasn't prepared to do this mostly because of morals. Unfortunately, i had neither wisdom nor age on my side which led to some needless confrontations with the management.
  
    Now L&T have this Management Trainee program where they put all the graduate recruits through a series of tests and interviews to determine whom to put on the MT program. In my department of 200 odd employees, we were 17 GETs (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written test round. Of the six who got through, five left the organisation within two years. Only one remains. This illustrated one thing to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  General Work
    Now, about work. Accusations were flying thick and fast right from the start about how regionalism and favouritism were rampant. Examples were cited. How much truth there was in these accusations, i cannot say. What i did observe was a persistent culture of ass licking. The boss is always right. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss must be worshipped. I did not subscribe to this school of thought and i made my views clear. I challenged my boss' views openly but politely. He did not take kindly to it. I only discovered this later.
  
    About work, L&T is basically a large contractor taking tech from abroad and just installing it in india. There is often little expertise that they actually contribute despite what the ads tell you. This was true in my department. Others, i cannot comment on. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from upper management. L&T has numerous internal companies manufacturing different pieces of equipment. The pressure was often to award contracts to these people instead of better quality and cheaper alternatives from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later when equipment was installed and found defective or just badly designed.
  Time pressures
    Everything had to be done in advance of contracted deadlines even if this meant storing sensitive equipment in the open at the mercy of the elements. No matter that the person who agreed to the deadlines had no actual idea how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to equipment being dispatched in pieces which were often not labelled and which were hard to reassemble later.
  Safety
    This existed as a token person claiming to be a safety officer on a construction site. The reality was that he was just there to claim compliance with some international standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything about blatant safety violations on a construction site. To name a few, daily wage labourers were found working with no fire safety equipment when welding and often inhaling dangerous fumes. Safety harnesses were often tattered and old. Mind you, this is from a company bidding for international contracts and i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    If you work at one of larsen & toubro's construction sites, your life is fucked. I am not saying this lightly. You work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""site allowance"". Facilities for accommodation will be terrible to begin with and will only improve should employees protest. Then too, improvements will be grudgingly made. The clients are infinitely more important than the employees. We were made to arrive at work at 0830 and leave at 1930. That is eleven hours, six days a week. Employees at the office in Gujarat got alternate saturdays off. We were not afforded this luxury because you know, you're our bitch. No recreation facilities despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The fact that were were given a ""site allowance"" was akin to asking a beggar to be satisfied with the 10 rupee note you've handed him. Taking sundays off was frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to avoid going to work on weekends.
  Performance Appraisals
    based on a normal distribution. I am not joking. Every department has to abide by this. This resulted in people working their asses off at a construction site being told that their work was under par because someone had to be in that category while people chilling in the office making power point presentations were told that their work was fantastic. More often than not, the top performers were decided based on regionalism. In a department headed by a bong, expect to see bongs as top performers.
  Employee satisfaction
    Seventeen GETs joined the company with me. I was number 14 to leave. After me, one more person left. The two that remain are still there. Every single one of my colleagues at my construction site were desperately searching for alternate jobs. Add to this the fact that GETs are treated like entitled kids while people with more experience joining the company from outside are treated like shit. This is no exaggeration. I've seen it first hand. Ask around yourself if you don't believe me. There was a Gallup survey that was conducted one year, the results of which were never made known to the employees. You can guess at the reasons.
  Pointless and Ineffective HR Practices
    Again, to claim compliance with international practices and to periodically appease employees, MANDATORY HR related courses would be forced down our throats every year. There was no choice given to employees. There did exist a system where you could choose what sort of training you wanted to receive ranging from technical to soft skills. Despite numerous requests, management just turned me down claiming that it was a waste of time. Yes, these people run the company and then wonder why people leave. Then there is the issue of bonds. Yes, every time the company invests more than a single rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a two year bond to begin with. Now, from what i hear, people are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some sort of executive training programs. Just how long the bond period is on that, i wonder.
  Racism
    Yes, it happened and it happened in the open. People were blind to it. A colleague and I were probably the only ones that noticed. The indian engineers were housed in an often muddy floored office. It was air conditioned so that was good. Anyone with white skin got a private office with their own internet connection and colour printer. The indians did not deserve either clean toilets or a colour printer or internet access. Yes, this actually happened. Caucasian people who were technician level but representing the western manufacturers of critical equipment got treatment fit for kings. Anyone indian looking, no matter which company they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The End
    After seeing numerous colleagues leave in frustration, i too threw in the towel. I was asked publicly whether i'd like to return. I answered no and was met with a stunned silence from all around me.
  Conclusions
    People leave bad managers, not companies, it is said. In the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a toxic combination of the two where your manager is powerless to fix the situation. The senior management is ageing and often slow to react to HR related issues. The passive nature of the HR setup is often partly responsible for this problem.

"When a large company like L&T gobbles up a minnow like MindTree, shouldn't the competition commission step in to prevent such crony capitalistic maneuver?","
    
    Two years ago from today, a thriving small cap company (one may even call it a startup!) called MindTree was gobbled up by L&T Infotech, a large capitalist corporation which is part of the L&T conglomerate. Only a few years ago, I was actually dreaming of applying and working in MindTree as I'd heard a lot about its reputation.
  
    If all startups end up being captured by larger companies like this, there won't be any diversity in the next 1-2 decades. Only a few large oligarchs like Infosys, TCS, L&T, etc. will thrive in the market.
  
    Is this what capitalism and free market economy means? I don't think so. People should be worried about this phenomenon irrespective of your core ideology (left/right wing, libertarian/liberal/conservative, etc.).
  
    People working at Infosys, etc. definitely won't care because they are getting their paychecks and ensuring competition in the markets isn't their job. But what is the CCI (Competition Commission of India) doing? Isn't it their job to prevent these kinds of acquisitions and to ensure that competition prevails in the Indian Economy? Are those guys sleeping or just pretending to be asleep?

L&T Infotech Vs Avanseus,"
    
    Hi everyone, I'm a 2022 Computer Science Graduate from a 3-tier college in Bangalore.
  
    I've received two offers, one from LTI and another from Avanseus.
  
    LTI:
  
      
    
    Salary is 8 LPA (Graduate Engineer Trainee-III)
  
  
    
    Service Based company
  
  
    
    Has MNC perks
  
  
    
    I may be on bench initially and would waste my time.
  
  
    
    I don't know on what technology I might work on. It might be very good and trending technology, might not be trending tech(like .NET)
  
  
    
    Has 2 year bond.
  
  
    
    Avanseus:
  
      
    
    Salary is not disclosed (I'm assuming max would be 7.5 LPA)
  
  
    
    Product Based company (Start up on AI/ML in Bangalore)
  
  
    
    Would have to work very much since it's a Start up
  
  
    
    Nothing like sitting on bench
  
  
    
    I would be working full-stack i.e., Spring Boot in backend, React in frontend and mongoDB. And a year later, I might work on Machine Learning.(They don't give ML to freshers.)
  
  
    
    I'm very much confused to choose the company to join. Should I look into any other aspects in a company? Please help me out in this.
  
    Also, if anyone is working in these companies, please DM so than I can ask any further doubts.
  
    PS: This is a throwaway account.

L&T Construction Secures EPC Orders for West Bengal Power Development Corporation,"
    
    In a recent development, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has announced its triumphant bid to secure an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract from the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited. This venture falls under the domain of L&T’s Power Transmission & Distribution Business and entails the establishment of wet Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems at the Sagardighi thermal power plant located in West Bengal.
  
    
   
     
        
      
    L&T: Engineering Powerhouse
  
    This pivotal project comprises the installation of three FGD absorbers designed to serve four thermal power units, specifically 2×300 MW and 2×500 MW capacity. Additionally, the EPC contract encompasses the deployment of various balance of plant systems intended to benefit five units within the power plant, as elucidated by the company in an official press release.
  
    This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone for L&T, as it represents their inaugural FGD project secured from a state-owned power utility. The backdrop for this project’s emergence is the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s mandate that necessitates the integration of FGD systems in both existing and forthcoming thermal power plants. This directive is primarily aimed at mitigating sulphur dioxide emissions, thereby bolstering environmental conservation efforts.
  
    With this latest EPC contract in hand, L&T is now poised to undertake FGD projects for thermal power plants boasting a cumulative capacity of over 19 GW. By actively participating in this endeavor, the company aligns itself with the government’s broader initiative to curtail sulphur dioxide emissions and foster a more sustainable and ecologically conscious power generation sector.
  
    On a parallel note, it is worth noting that L&T Construction’s Transportation Infrastructure business vertical has also been making strides in infrastructure development. Recently, they secured a contract to construct a bridge connecting Dahisar and Bhayander in Mumbai. This contract, awarded by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), holds the promise of substantially reducing travel time between these two regions, which currently takes nearly 45 minutes.
  
    The bridge, measuring 4.5 kilometers in length, will feature two separate carriageways and incorporate multi-level interchanges at Dahisar and Bhayander to ensure seamless entry and exit for commuters. Additionally, the project will showcase two large navigational spans along the creek, further enhancing its significance and functionality.
  
    In accordance with L&T’s project classification index, this undertaking falls into the “Large” category, indicative of its substantial scale and magnitude. This project is estimated to have a construction value ranging between Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, underscoring its substantial economic and infrastructural impact on the region.

A word of caution to freshers - My experience with Larsen & Toubro,"
    
    created from throwaway for apparent motives.
  starting point
    5th semester of engineering college in India. L&T are commonly most of the first organizations to reach on the common campus for interviews. there is normally the funda where as soon as a pupil has a task offer, he or she isn't allowed to wait subsequent interviews. properly, 4 other human beings and i were all decided on by means of Larsen & Toubro. ok. We have been ecstatic. Then got here the surprise of the beginning package deal which become barely touching three lakhs a year. good enough, we swallowed that after professors and senior college students advised us that L&T turned into a tremendous location to start your career. best. This turned into compared to five+ for numerous other agencies. even as at this point in your profession, you need the enterprise extra than the employer desires you, it ought to be said that people, specially college students, will evaluate salaries. this is the starting point that produces disgruntled personnel. money, while no longer the only component, is essential.
  
    next got here the recession. Mid manner through the 7th semester we get a letter from L&T stating that they won't be able to recruit all and sundry and that we must start searching out trade opportunities. that is almost a 12 months after the original offer, by means of which era different huge corporates have ended their campus recruitment drives and we are left excessive and dry with out a assured employment. good enough. Making the first-rate of the situation, I searched difficult and observed jobs at 3 distinction organizations. A month into the activity, i am getting a call from L&T pointing out that I can be offered a task the subsequent month. good enough. Being naive and now not too happy with my present job, i decided to take the provide. So i be a part of, along with all and sundry else who became initially recruited. superb news thus far.
  
    Then comes working at Larsen and Toubro. i used to be assigned to their office in Gujarat. I need to point out that every single Maharashtrian with a hindu sounding call become assigned a few or the alternative branch in Powai, Mumbai. adequate, no complaints from me.
  
    Now the shitty component. i ended up at a branch rife with ass licking and people bent on getting promotions via doing regardless of the boss requested for. I wasn't prepared to do that in general due to morals. sadly, i had neither know-how nor age on my side which brought about some needless confrontations with the control.
  
    Now L&T have this control Trainee software in which they placed all of the graduate recruits thru a series of checks and interviews to decide whom to place at the MT program. In my department of two hundred unusual personnel, we were 17 gets (Graduate Engineer Trainees). Of the 17, seven made it past the first written check spherical. Of the six who got through, 5 left the organisation within  years. most effective one stays. This illustrated one element to me:  the alarmingly high attrition rates.
  general paintings
    Now, approximately work. Accusations were flying thick and rapid right from the begin approximately how regionalism and favouritism have been rampant. Examples were mentioned. How a great deal fact there has been in those accusations, i can't say. What i did study changed into a continual lifestyle of ass licking. The boss is constantly proper. The boss controls your performance appraisal. The boss have to be worshipped. I did now not join this school of idea and that i made my perspectives clean. I challenged my boss' views brazenly however with courtesy. He did not take kindly to it. I simplest found this later.
  
    about work, L&T is basically a big contractor taking tech from overseas and simply installing it in india. there is often little expertise that they virtually make a contribution in spite of what the advertisements let you know. This became authentic in my branch. Others, i cannot touch upon. I saw equipment contracts being assigned based on favouritism and pressures from top control. L&T has severa internal companies manufacturing special portions of equipment. The stress turned into regularly to award contracts to those humans instead of better excellent and cheaper options from outside. This disturbed me greatly and created problems later while equipment was hooked up and discovered faulty or simply badly designed.
  Time pressures
    the entirety needed to be done earlier of shriveled cut-off dates even supposing this supposed storing sensitive device in the open on the mercy of the elements. no matter that the person that agreed to the cut-off dates had no real concept how long something would take to manufacture. This lead to gadget being dispatched in portions which have been often now not labelled and which have been tough to reassemble later.
  protection
    This existed as a token individual claiming to be a safety officer on a construction website. The fact become that he was simply there to assert compliance with a few global standards. He often ended up being powerless to do anything approximately blatant protection violations on a construction site. to name some, daily wage labourers were observed operating with no fire safety gadget whilst welding and regularly breathing in risky fumes. safety harnesses were regularly tattered and antique. thoughts you, that is from a enterprise bidding for worldwide contracts and that i don't mean just in Nepal and Bangladesh.
  Timings
    in case you work at one of larsen & toubro's production web sites, your existence is fucked. i am now not announcing this lightly. you work longer hours in the heat of the sun and are paid a pittance as a ""website online allowance"". centers for lodging could be horrible initially and could simplest enhance must personnel protest. Then too, upgrades will be grudgingly made. The customers are infinitely greater critical than the employees. We had been made to arrive at work at 0830 and go away at 1930. that is eleven hours, six days every week. personnel at the office in Gujarat were given trade saturdays off. We had been no longer afforded this luxury because you realize, you're our bitch. No pastime centers despite being made to live in the middle of nowhere. No gym, no perks in lieu of a more inconvenient life, nothing. The reality that had been had been given a ""website allowance"" become comparable to asking a beggar to be glad with the 10 rupee be aware you have exceeded him. Taking sundays off become frowned upon. I used the religious excuse which no one in india will dare question to keep away from going to paintings on weekends.
  performance value determinations
    based totally on a ordinary distribution. i am not joking. every branch has to abide by using this. This led to humans operating their asses off at a production website being instructed that their paintings became under par because a person had to be in that class even as humans chilling within the workplace making electricity point presentations had been informed that their work became exquisite. extra frequently than not, the pinnacle performers were determined based totally on regionalism. In a department headed via a bong, expect to see bongs as pinnacle performers.
  employee pleasure
    Seventeen receives joined the agency with me. i used to be variety 14 to depart. After me, one greater character left. the 2 that remain are nonetheless there. each unmarried one of my colleagues at my creation website have been desperately attempting to find trade jobs. add to this the truth that receives are treated like entitled children even as humans with greater experience becoming a member of the employer from out of doors are dealt with like shit. this is no exaggeration. i have seen it first hand. Ask round your self if you don't believe me. there has been a Gallup survey that changed into carried out 12 months, the consequences of which were in no way made recognized to the employees. you can wager at the reasons.
  pointless and ineffective HR Practices
    once more, to say compliance with international practices and to periodically appease personnel, obligatory HR associated publications might be compelled down our throats each yr. there has been no preference given to personnel. There did exist a machine in which you may choose what sort of education you wanted to obtain ranging from technical to soft skills. notwithstanding severa requests, control simply became me down claiming that it changed into a waste of time. yes, those people run the company and then surprise why human beings depart. Then there may be the difficulty of bonds. sure, whenever the company invests more than a unmarried rupee in you, you are made to sign a bond. I had a  yr bond initially. Now, from what i pay attention, human beings are being sent to IIM ahmedabad for some kind of government schooling programs. simply how long the bond duration is on that, i'm wondering.
  Racism
    yes, it occurred and it happened within the open. people had been unaware of it. A colleague and that i were probably the handiest ones that noticed. The indian engineers had been housed in an often muddy floored workplace. It changed into air conditioned so that become true. each person with white skin were given a non-public office with their personal internet connection and coloration printer. The indians did no longer deserve either easy toilets or a color printer or internet get admission to. yes, this genuinely passed off. Caucasian folks who have been technician level however representing the western manufacturers of vital device got treatment in shape for kings. each person indian looking, irrespective of which business enterprise they represented was housed with the rest of the scum.
  The end
    After seeing severa colleagues depart in frustration, i too threw inside the towel. i used to be asked publicly whether or not i'd like to go back. I answered no and become met with a bowled over silence from all round me.
  Conclusions
    people leave horrific managers, now not agencies, it is said. inside the case of Larsen & Toubro, it is often a poisonous aggregate of the 2 where your manager is powerless to restoration the situation. The senior management is ageing and often gradual to react to HR related troubles. The passive nature of the HR setup is frequently in part liable for this hassle. employees are often left with recourse or answers to their problems. The desired manner out is to leave. you could evaluate the attrition charges for L&T (no longer infotech) and the average IT agency and each will be similar. those numbers are because of a systemic problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.
  
    TL;DR in case you're studying to grow to be an engineer, think two times earlier than becoming a member of Larsen & Toubro. this is my honest recommendation. on the other hand, this will be the scenario in maximum indian engineering / contracting agencies.
